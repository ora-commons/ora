## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Depth in Argument Audit is the degree to which the cross-cutting-integration stage produces issues that no single component pass would catch alone. A thin molecular pass concatenates frame-audit and coherence-audit outputs; a substantive pass identifies where coherence depends on contested frame-imports, where coherence-failures track frame-substitutions across claims, and where motte-and-bailey-style structure operates across an argument's parts. Test depth by asking: does the audit name a structural move that requires both frame-perception and coherence-tracking to detect?

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Breadth in Argument Audit is the catalog of frames considered before frame-audit narrows. Widen the lens to scan: dominant-paradigm frame; minority-tradition frame; rhetorical-genre frame; historical-genealogy frame. Even when the cross-cutting-integration narrows to specific cross-cutting issues, breadth is documented in the frame-surfacing-findings section. Note: alternative compositions considered included adding propaganda-audit; current composition stays neutral and routes to propaganda-audit when artifact is propaganda-engineered.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Argument Audit is a molecular argument-evaluation method that integrates frame-audit and coherence-audit into a single pass, producing cross-cutting findings neither component pass would catch alone. It is descriptive of argument structure, not evaluative of conclusion truth — stance-bearing verdicts ("the argument is dishonest," "the conclusion is wrong") route to T15 modes (steelman, red-team variants, balanced-critique) rather than appearing in the audit output.

**Procedure.**

1. State the argument under audit once at the head — claim, supporting moves, conclusion.
2. Decompose each claim into Toulmin elements — claim, grounds, warrant, backing, qualifier, rebuttal.
3. Run per-claim coherence audit — verdict (holds / fails / partially holds) with the specific claim-pair or inference step cited as structural reason.
4. Run frame audit — for each frame surfaced, name the specific premise that carries the import and what alternative frames it displaces.
5. Integrate cross-cuttingly — find issues that require BOTH frame-perception and coherence-tracking: frame-imports doing inferential work coherence alone misses, coherence-failures tracking frame-substitutions across claims, motte-and-bailey-style alternation operating across multiple claims.
6. Name fallacies only with structural warrant — invoke Walton schemes (expert opinion, position to know, cause to effect, analogy) with the argument's actual premises matched to the scheme; invoke motte-and-bailey only when motte claim, bailey claim, and alternation point are each named.
7. Stay neutral on conclusion-truth — flag any drift into stance-bearing evaluation as out-of-scope.
8. Calibrate confidence — synthesis-stage atoms inherit lower confidence than component-stage atoms.

**Goal.** Produce an integrated argument audit that identifies structural moves the constituent passes (frame-audit, coherence-audit) cannot detect alone, with each finding traceable to a specific claim, premise, or inference step.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — integration vs concatenation (load-bearing).** Does the cross-cutting-integration stage surface issues neither component pass would catch alone, or does it merely concatenate them? Failure mode if unmet: `integration-failure`.
- **CQ2 — frame-import specificity.** Are frame-imports identified concretely (which premises smuggle in which framings), or noted vaguely? Failure mode if unmet: `frame-import-vagueness`.
- **CQ3 — coherence grounding.** Are coherence findings grounded in specific claim-pairs and inference steps, or stated as general impressions? Failure mode if unmet: `coherence-impressionism`.
- **CQ4 — fallacy warrant.** Where named fallacies are invoked (motte-and-bailey, equivocation, etc.), is the invocation specific and warranted with the structural move shown? Failure mode if unmet: `fallacy-labeling-without-warrant`.

A passing output names the argument's Toulmin decomposition per claim, surfaces frames at the level of specific premises, produces at least one cross-cutting integration atom that requires both passes to detect, warrants any named fallacy with structural detail, and stays descriptive of argument structure.

**Named failure modes.**

- *integration-failure* — cross-cutting-issues section restates per-claim and frame findings without identifying interactions between them.
- *frame-import-vagueness* — frame findings refer to "the frame" or "the assumption" without naming which premise carries which import.
- *coherence-impressionism* — coherence findings cite no specific claim-pair or inference step.
- *fallacy-labeling-without-warrant* — named fallacies invoked without showing the specific structural move.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to deepen synthesis where it concatenates. Revise to add specificity to vague frame-imports or impressionistic coherence findings. Revise to warrant named fallacies with structural detail. Resist revising toward stance-bearing evaluation — Argument Audit is neutral; stance-bearing evaluation belongs in T15 (steelman, the red-team modes, balanced-critique). Stop at the audit. Do not announce, flag, or recommend stance-bearing follow-up in the output.

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **integrated argument-audit atoms with explicit cross-cutting findings**: per-claim coherence atoms from coherence-audit, frame-surfacing atoms from frame-audit, cross-cutting integration atoms (the molecular value), named-fallacy atoms with structural warrant, and articulation-script atoms. The atoms are:

1. **Argument-summary atom.** The argument under audit stated once at the corpus head — claim, supporting moves, conclusion.

2. **Per-claim coherence atoms (coherence-audit provenance).** Each carries: claim being audited, Toulmin-decomposed elements (claim / grounds / warrant / backing / qualifier / rebuttal), and the coherence verdict (holds / fails / partially-holds) with structural reason. Coherence-impressionism is the named failure mode; impressionistic verdicts without claim-pair or inference-step citations do not survive.

3. **Frame-surfacing atoms (frame-audit provenance).** Each carries: frame name, the specific premise or claim that imports it, the alternative frames it displaces, what is hidden by the frame. Frame-import-vagueness is the named failure mode; "the argument operates within X frame" without naming the importing premise does not survive.

4. **Cross-cutting integration atoms.** The molecular value — each atom names a structural issue requiring BOTH frame-perception and coherence-tracking to detect (a frame-import doing load-bearing inferential work coherence-audit alone misses; a coherence-failure that tracks a frame-substitution across claims; motte-and-bailey-style structure operating across the argument). At minimum one cross-cutting atom; integration-failure is the named failure mode (cross-cutting section concatenating component findings without identifying interactions).

5. **Named-fallacy atoms with structural warrant.** Each carries: the named fallacy (motte-and-bailey, equivocation, composition, etc.), the specific structural move (which claim is motte, which is bailey, where the alternation occurs), and the warrant for the label. Fallacy-labeling-without-warrant is the named failure mode; bare labels do not survive.

6. **Argument-soundness assessment atom.** A single corpus-level verdict integrating frame and coherence findings (not single-component): `the argument as given [holds / fails / partially-holds] because [structural reason that integrates both component findings]`.

7. **Articulation-script atoms.** Per surfaced issue, a usable line for the user to deploy in conversation. Each carries: the surfaced issue (cross-reference to atoms 2-5), a one-to-three-sentence usable line, and the context where it applies.

8. **Component-provenance tags.** Each atom in items 2-5 carries `[from frame-audit]` / `[from coherence-audit]` / `[cross-cutting]`. Tags make integration auditable; silo-aggregation is visible when atoms cluster within single-component tags rather than interleaving.

9. **Residual uncertainties + confidence per finding.** Confidence markers attach to findings; synthesis-stage atoms inherit lower confidence than component-stage atoms.

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut during the bloat strip:**

- **Per-claim restatement across components** — when frame-audit and coherence-audit both surfaced findings about the same claim with parallel framings, collapse to single atoms with both components' insights merged.
- **Vague frame-imports** — "the argument operates within X frame" without naming which specific premise imports it.
- **Coherence-impressionism** — "the reasoning is shaky" / "something feels off" without claim-pairs or inference-step citations.
- **Bare fallacy labels** — invoking motte-and-bailey, equivocation, etc. without the structural move that warrants the label.
- **Integration-failure residue** — cross-cutting-issues section restating per-claim and frame findings without identifying the inter-component interactions.
- **Stance-bearing evaluative language** — "the argument is wrong / bad / dishonest" residue. Argument Audit is neutral; stance-bearing evaluation belongs in T15 modes.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **Cross-stream cross-cutting-interpretation differences** — when streams identified different structural cross-cutting issues, preserve both as parallel atoms.
- **Frame-vs-coherence interpretation disagreement for the same finding** — when one stream read a finding as primarily frame-based and the other as primarily coherence-based, preserve both interpretations as parallel atoms (the disagreement is itself an integration finding).
- **Articulation-script variations** — when streams produced different usable lines for the same surfaced issue, preserve both. Multiple scripts is breadth.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: both component passes ran (or were flagged as proceeded-with-gap); cross-cutting integration surfaces issues neither component caught alone; frame-imports and coherence findings are concretely grounded; named fallacies are warranted with structural specificity; user-facing articulation scripts are present and usable; the four critical questions are addressed in the response. The response is conversational prose addressed to the user — verification does not require any specific section structure, only that the content contract is satisfied.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is a **conversational audit addressed to the user, lead-with-the-flaw, with articulation scripts at the end**. The audit's findings reach the user via flowing prose, not via numbered methodology sections. Place the consolidated-corpus atoms into the deliverable in this order:

1. **Lead H2 heading — name the central flaw.** The first line of the deliverable is an H2 heading naming the integrated finding in plain language. Examples: `## The argument relies on a hidden premise about agency`, `## Your friend is doing a frame swap, not an argument`, `## The "just statistics" move is doing all the work`. The heading IS the lead — no preamble before it. The heading is conversational, not academic; do not name analytical methods in it.

2. **Body — flowing prose, integrated findings.** Walk through the supporting findings as paragraphs in this order:
   - The framing move the argument relies on (from frame-surfacing atoms, in plain language — "the argument frames X as Y", not "the Lakoff frame here")
   - The hidden premise or inferential gap the argument needs to work (from per-claim coherence atoms, in plain language)
   - The cross-cutting issue — where frame-import and coherence-failure interact (the molecular value, surfaced as the audit's distinctive contribution that single-component audits would miss)
   - Named fallacies (motte-and-bailey, composition / reductionist fallacy, straw man, equivocation) in plain language with structural detail — name the specific move, not just the label

   No numbered section headers (`### 1. Charitable Reconstruction`, `### 2. Toulmin Decomposition`). No methodology labels (Toulmin Decomposition, Mereological Audit, Audit Summary). Paragraphs only in the body.

3. **Articulation scripts — register-change transition.** After the analytical findings, transition with a single second H2: `## Here's what you can say back` or similar. This is one of the few times a second H2 is appropriate — a real change of register from analysis to deployment.

   Render each script as: a short setup ("when your friend says X..."), the usable line ("you can say back: …"), and a one-sentence why ("this works because it points to the structural move you surfaced above"). Three to five scripts is typical.

4. **Where Debate D2 (motte-and-bailey) is invoked.** Name the structural move in the argument's terms — which claim is the motte (defensible / modest), which is the bailey (ambitious / desired), where the alternation occurs. Do not rely on the label alone. Note in passing whether Shackel's doctrinal usage or the wider fallacy-label usage best fits ("this looks like a doctrine-level alternation, not just a single move").

5. **Confidence inline only where meaningful.** Use natural confidence language inline ("almost certainly", "probably", "I'm less sure about this part") only where confidence varies meaningfully across findings. Do NOT emit a standalone Confidence Map, Provenance Attribution, Content Contract Checklist, or Continuity Prompt — those belong in orchestrator metadata.

**Per-section conventions:**

- The deliverable's first character is `#` (the lead H2). No preamble of any kind.
- Use H2 only for the lead heading and the articulation-scripts transition. No other section headers in the body.
- Avoid pipeline-machinery vocabulary throughout: "frame-audit findings", "coherence-audit findings", "the cross-cutting integration stage", "Stream A vs Stream B" — those belong inside the orchestrator.
- Avoid methodology badges: do not label what you're doing as "Toulmin decomposition" or "Walton scheme classification" — let the analysis land as substance.
- The deliverable ends when the substance ends. No decorative close, no aphoristic signature line.

## CAVEATS AND OPEN DEBATES

**Debate D2 — Motte-and-bailey: fallacy or doctrine?** Shackel (2005, "The Vacuity of Postmodernist Methodology") introduced the term as a *doctrine* — a structural feature of certain argumentative positions in which an arguer alternates between a defensible "motte" (modest claim) and a desirable "bailey" (ambitious claim) when challenged. Shackel's preferred usage frames motte-and-bailey as a *characterization of a doctrine's structure*, not as a fallacy committed in a single inferential step. In wider usage (online discourse, popular argumentation guides), the term has come to function as a *fallacy label* applied to single moves where an arguer retreats from an ambitious claim under pressure. This mode operates without adjudicating the debate: when motte-and-bailey is invoked, the audit names the structural move in the argument's terms (which claim is motte, which is bailey, where the alternation occurs) rather than relying on the label alone, and notes whether Shackel's doctrinal usage or the wider fallacy-label usage best fits the case. Consumers seeking a stricter Shackel-aligned reading should treat motte-and-bailey invocations as doctrinal characterizations requiring multi-claim evidence; consumers using the wider sense may accept single-move applications. Citations: Shackel 2005; cf. wider discussion in popular argumentation literature.

## DEFAULT GEAR

Gear 4

Argument Audit's molecular composition (parallel frame-audit + coherence-audit with three synthesis stages) is a Gear 4 workload. Gear 4 runs Depth and Breadth in parallel, then composes through Steps 5–7 (cross-eval, revise, consolidate). The consolidator's role is exactly the role this mode's synthesis stages require.
