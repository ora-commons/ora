## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Depth in Third Side is the rigor with which the ten Ury roles are surveyed across the three role-clusters, with each role linked to actual bearers in the surrounding community. A thin pass names "mediator" generically; a substantive pass: (1) maps the surrounding community/network — colleagues, friends, family, neighbors, leaders, professionals, institutions, norms — that constitute the third side as a social fact; (2) surveys the ten roles in their three clusters: **prevention** (provider — addresses frustrated needs that drive conflict; teacher — gives skills for conflict-handling; bridge-builder — develops relationships that pre-empt conflict), **resolution** (mediator — facilitates communication; arbiter — judges when self-resolution fails; equalizer — democratizes power asymmetry; healer — addresses injured emotions and broken relationships), **containment** (witness — pays attention so escalation has consequences; referee — establishes rules for fair fight; peacekeeper — interposes when violence threatens); (3) identifies which roles are *active* (already being filled, well or poorly), which are *needed but unfilled*, and which are *not yet relevant but may become so*; (4) names candidate bearers per role from the surrounding community; (5) recommends specific third-side interventions keyed to role gaps; (6) acknowledges the limits — power asymmetry that makes mediation cover for coercion, parties' agency that makes intervention intrusive, situations requiring confrontation rather than mediation. Test depth by asking: could the analysis tell the user which one or two role gaps, if filled, would change the conflict's trajectory most?

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Widening the lens means scanning the surrounding community in three rings (intimate — family / close colleagues; mid — extended network / institutional context; outer — wider community / public / norms); surveying all three role-clusters (prevention / resolution / containment) before narrowing; considering escalation signals (rhetoric hardening, third-party recruitment to one side, breakdown of channels of communication, emergence of public symbolic markers, threats of exit or violence); and considering parallel third-side traditions (Lederach's conflict-transformation lineage on identity-rooted conflict; Kriesberg's constructive-conflicts trajectory analysis; restorative justice; indigenous and traditional dispute-resolution practices that may already exist in the community). Breadth markers: all ten Ury roles considered (even if most are not active); all three role-clusters considered; the surrounding community mapped in at least two rings; escalation signals listed; the limits of third-side intervention acknowledged.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Third Side is Ury's third-side mediation analysis — a mediator-stance multi-party reading of a conflict from the surrounding community's vantage. It surveys the ten Ury roles (provider / teacher / bridge-builder / mediator / arbiter / equalizer / healer / witness / referee / peacekeeper) across three clusters (prevention / resolution / containment), linking each active or needed role to actual bearers in the community. It is distinct from interest-mapping (party-stance, two-party-default, depth-light), principled-negotiation (party-stance, two-party-default, depth-thorough), stakeholder-mapping (T8 descriptive multi-party without active conflict-resolution framing), strategic-interaction (T18 game-theoretic equilibria/coalitions), and boundary-critique (T2 policy/excluded-voices analysis).

**Procedure.**

1. Summarise parties and the conflict in neutral third-side stance — not party-stance.
2. Map the surrounding community in three rings — intimate (family / close colleagues), mid (extended network / institutional context), outer (wider community / public / norms). The third side is a *social fact* that may or may not contain the roles needed.
3. Survey the ten Ury roles across three clusters: **prevention** (provider, teacher, bridge-builder), **resolution** (mediator, arbiter, equalizer, healer), **containment** (witness, referee, peacekeeper) — each tagged `active` / `needed but unfilled` / `not yet relevant`.
4. Link each active or needed role to a named bearer in the surrounding community — actual person, institution, or norm. Abstract role assertions without candidates are reshaped.
5. Filter bearer candidates through cultural context — the community's norms, hierarchies, and existing institutions shape who can credibly fill which role.
6. Surface escalation signals (rhetoric hardening, third-party recruitment, channel breakdown, public symbolic markers, threats of exit/violence) and the cluster-shift they imply (typically toward containment).
7. Recommend candidate third-side interventions, each keyed to a specific role gap and a candidate bearer — at least two.
8. Flag unknowns testable in practice — questions whose answers would change the role analysis.
9. Acknowledge intervention limits — where power asymmetry makes mediation cover for coercion, where parties' agency requires confrontation rather than mediation, where third-side intervention would be intrusive.
10. Maintain third-side stance throughout (no party-stance creep) and parties-as-agents discipline (not passive objects of intervention).
11. Provide three-kind confidence per finding: role-need / bearer-availability / intervention-effectiveness, kept distinct.

**Goal.** Produce a Ury third-side mediation analysis that surveys all ten roles across three clusters, links each active or needed role to a named bearer in the surrounding community, surfaces escalation signals and intervention limits, and maintains third-side stance throughout.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — third-side stance maintained.** Has the analysis stayed at "what the surrounding community can do" rather than slipping into party-side advocacy for one party's interests? Failure mode if unmet: `party-stance-creep`.
- **CQ2 — ten-role checklist surveyed.** Have the ten Ury roles been considered as a checklist rather than collapsing into a generic mediator role? Failure mode if unmet: `ten-role-collapse`.
- **CQ3 — three role-clusters considered.** Have prevention, resolution, and containment all been considered, rather than defaulting to resolution roles only? Failure mode if unmet: `prevention-or-containment-omission`.
- **CQ4 — roles linked to bearers.** Have role assignments been linked to actual people / institutions / norms in the surrounding community, rather than asserting roles in the abstract? Failure mode if unmet: `roles-without-bearers`.
- **CQ5 — limits acknowledged.** Have the limits of third-side intervention been acknowledged — power asymmetry, parties' primary agency, situations requiring confrontation — rather than asserting third side as universally appropriate? Failure mode if unmet: `third-side-overreach`.

A passing output names parties and conflict in neutral stance, maps the surrounding community in at least two rings, surveys the ten roles across all three clusters with status per role, names bearer candidates for active or needed roles, surfaces escalation signals, recommends at least two specific interventions keyed to role gaps, flags testable unknowns, acknowledges intervention limits, and keeps three confidence kinds distinct.

**Named failure modes.**

- *party-stance-creep* — analysis recommends moves that favor one party's interests rather than analyzing what the surrounding community can do; output reads as advocacy.
- *ten-role-collapse* — output names only mediator (or only one or two of the ten roles); the full ten-role checklist is not surveyed.
- *prevention-or-containment-omission* — output addresses only resolution roles; prevention and/or containment clusters not addressed.
- *roles-without-bearers* — roles listed without naming actual people / institutions / norms who could fill them.
- *third-side-overreach* — analysis asserts third-side intervention as appropriate without considering its limits (power asymmetry covering coercion, parties' agency, situations requiring confrontation).
- *cultural-context-flatness* — third-side roles applied without considering how surrounding-community cultural norms, hierarchies, and institutions shape availability.
- *parties-as-passive* — parties framed as objects of third-side intervention rather than agents whose own moves matter.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to restore third-side stance where the draft slipped into party advocacy. Revise to expand the role survey where the draft collapsed to mediator-only. Revise to address prevention and containment where the draft addressed only resolution. Revise to name bearers where the draft asserted roles in the abstract. Revise to acknowledge limits where the draft asserted third-side as universally appropriate. Revise to honor parties' agency where the draft positioned them as passive objects of intervention. Resist revising toward generic mediator-talk — the mode's analytical character is the *ten-role-and-three-cluster* frame, not generic mediation; collapsing back to "mediator" is a failure mode, not a polish. Resist revising toward over-confident community capacity assertions — sometimes the surrounding community lacks the third side the conflict needs, and naming that is part of honest analysis.

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **a Ury third-side atom set: parties-and-conflict summary, surrounding-community mapping, ten-role atoms across three clusters (prevention / resolution / containment), role-assignment atoms linking each role to actual bearers, escalation-signal atoms, candidate intervention atoms keyed to role gaps, flagged-unknown atoms, three-kind confidence (role-need / bearer-availability / intervention-effectiveness), and a standing third-side-stance discipline**. The atoms are:

1. **Parties-and-conflict summary atom.** Each party named and the conflict characterised neutrally (third-side stance, not party-stance).

2. **Surrounding-community-or-network mapping atoms.** Each atom names: an actor / institution / norm in the surrounding community/network — at intimate, mid, and outer rings (family / close colleagues; extended network / institutional context; wider community / public / norms). The third side is a *social fact* that may or may not contain the roles needed.

3. **Prevention-role atoms — Ury cluster 1.** Each atom names one of three prevention roles (`provider` — addresses frustrated needs that drive conflict; `teacher` — gives skills for conflict-handling; `bridge-builder` — develops relationships that pre-empt conflict), plus its status (`active` / `needed but unfilled` / `not yet relevant`).

4. **Resolution-role atoms — Ury cluster 2.** Each atom names one of four resolution roles (`mediator` — facilitates communication; `arbiter` — judges when self-resolution fails; `equalizer` — democratises power asymmetry; `healer` — addresses injured emotions and broken relationships), plus status.

5. **Containment-role atoms — Ury cluster 3.** Each atom names one of three containment roles (`witness` — pays attention so escalation has consequences; `referee` — establishes rules for fair fight; `peacekeeper` — interposes when violence threatens), plus status.

6. **Ten-role checklist completeness check.** Ten-role-collapse is the named failure mode the consolidator watches for; outputs that named only "mediator" generically (or only one or two roles) get reshaped to survey the full checklist. Prevention-or-containment-omission is the named failure mode for cluster-imbalance; analyses addressing only resolution roles get reshaped to address prevention and containment.

7. **Role-assignment candidate atoms — per active or needed role.** Each atom names: an actual person / institution / norm in the surrounding community who could fill the role. Roles-without-bearers is the named failure mode; abstract role assertions without named candidates get reshaped.

8. **Escalation-signal atoms.** Each atom names: a signal that the conflict is escalating (rhetoric hardening, third-party recruitment to one side, breakdown of communication channels, emergence of public symbolic markers, threats of exit or violence) and the role-cluster shift it implies (escalation typically shifts containment toward primary).

9. **Candidate intervention atoms — keyed to role gaps.** Each atom names: a specific third-side intervention, the role gap it addresses, and the candidate bearer.

10. **Flagged-unknown atoms.** Testable in practice — questions the user (or the mediator) can investigate that would change the role analysis.

11. **Intervention-limit atoms.** Where third-side intervention may be inappropriate (power asymmetry that makes mediation cover for coercion; parties' own agency requiring confrontation rather than mediation; situations where third-side intervention is intrusive), the limits surface explicitly. Third-side-overreach is the named failure mode; analyses asserting third-side as universally appropriate get reshaped.

12. **Cultural-context flag — when applicable.** Where surrounding-community cultural norms, hierarchies, and institutions shape which roles are available and who can credibly fill them, the flag surfaces. Cultural-context-flatness is the named failure mode.

13. **Parties-as-agents discipline.** A standing atom: parties are *agents*, not passive objects of third-side intervention. Third-side roles support parties' own moves. Parties-as-passive is the named failure mode.

14. **Third-side-stance discipline.** A standing atom: analysis stays at "what can the surrounding community do" rather than slipping into "what should party X do". Party-stance-creep is the named failure mode.

15. **Three-kind confidence per finding.** Role-need (often higher), bearer-availability (often lower), intervention-effectiveness (depends on context). Kept distinct.

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut:**

- **Party-stance creep** — recommendations favoring one party rather than what the third side can do for the conflict as a whole.
- **Ten-role collapse** — generic mediator-talk; the full Ury ten-role checklist absent.
- **Cluster imbalance** — only resolution roles addressed; prevention and containment elided.
- **Roles without bearers** — abstract role assertions without named candidates.
- **Third-side overreach** — third-side framed as universally appropriate; limits unacknowledged.
- **Cultural-context flatness** — roles applied without considering whether the surrounding community's institutions and norms can credibly fill them.
- **Parties-as-passive** — third-side positioned as solving the conflict rather than supporting party agency.
- **Generic mediator-talk** — collapsing back to "mediator" rather than the ten-role-and-three-cluster frame.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **The ten-role checklist** — full survey required; partial coverage gets reshaped.
- **Three-cluster framing** — prevention / resolution / containment distinctions are operative.
- **Stream disagreement about which roles are needed** — when streams identified different role-need patterns, both survive with their respective reasoning.
- **Intervention-limit atoms** — never deleted for cleanliness; the mode's honesty requires acknowledging where the third side cannot help.
- **Three confidence kinds** — never blended into a single confidence value.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: parties and conflict named; surrounding community/network mapped; all three role-clusters (prevention / resolution / containment) addressed; the ten Ury roles surveyed (active / needed / not-yet-relevant per role); role-assignment candidates link roles to actual bearers; escalation signals listed; at least two specific third-side interventions named with role-gap rationale; flagged unknowns testable in practice; intervention limits acknowledged where context warrants; the five critical questions are addressable from the output. Confidence per major finding accompanies each claim. The third-side stance is maintained throughout (no party advocacy creep).

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

    - `Role-need: [confidence and basis — typically higher].`
    - `Bearer-availability: [confidence and basis — typically lower].`
    - `Intervention-effectiveness: [confidence and basis — depends on context].`

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 10.
- Ury ten-role vocabulary (`provider` / `teacher` / `bridge-builder` / `mediator` / `arbiter` / `equalizer` / `healer` / `witness` / `referee` / `peacekeeper`) appears verbatim with operative meanings preserved per role.
- Three-cluster framing (prevention / resolution / containment) appears as the structural backbone of sections 3–5.
- Roles link to *named bearers* in section 6 — abstract role assertions are reshaped at this layer.
- The third-side stance is maintained throughout — party-stance creep gets reshaped to community-stance analysis at every section.
- Limits acknowledgement: when third-side overreach was flagged, the deliverable carries: `**Note on intervention limits:** [where third-side intervention may be inappropriate — power asymmetry that makes mediation cover for coercion / parties' agency requiring confrontation / intrusive intervention]. These limits should be honoured before deploying the interventions in section 8.`
- When cultural-context flatness was flagged, section 6 carries: `**Cultural-context note:** the surrounding community's norms and hierarchies shape which roles can credibly be filled. The bearer candidates above are filtered through this context; in another cultural setting the same roles would require different bearers.`
- Confidence (section 10) stays as three distinct kinds; blending is reshaped.

## CAVEATS AND OPEN DEBATES

This mode does not carry mode-specific debates. The Wave 2 sibling `interest-mapping` and the Wave 3 sibling `principled-negotiation` carry **Debate D6** (Fisher-Ury sufficiency for adversarial contexts; Voss critique), which bears on third-side intervention obliquely: when a third party coaches one of the parties in negotiation method, the choice of method (Fisher-Ury integrative vs. Voss tactical-empathy adversarial) is a third-side decision the analysis may need to address. The `voss-tactical-empathy` lens is carried optionally for that case. The territory-level question of how mediator-stance interacts with deep-identity / community-rooted conflicts (Lederach's transformation lineage) and with conflicts that have historical trajectory (Kriesberg's constructive-conflicts) is treated as breadth scanning rather than as a mode-specific debate; both lenses are carried optionally for context where the Ury ten-role frame benefits from supplementation. Citations: Ury 2000 *The Third Side: Why We Fight and How We Can Stop*; Lederach 2003 *The Little Book of Conflict Transformation*; Kriesberg & Dayton 2017 *Constructive Conflicts*; Fisher, Ury & Patton 1981/2011 *Getting to Yes* for the cross-reference to party-side method.
