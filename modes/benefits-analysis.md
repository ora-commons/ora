## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Depth in Benefits Analysis is the specificity and mechanism-grounding of each column item. A thin pass produces generic claims ("improved efficiency", "potential risks"); a substantive pass names mechanism per claim (the literal phrase "mechanism:" anchors each Plus). Test depth by asking: could the same Plus or Minus apply to a different proposal? If yes, the claim is generic. The Interesting column carries particular depth weight — second-order items (precedent, signaling, path-dependency) are where motivated-optimism analysis typically underperforms.

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Breadth in Benefits Analysis is the survey of affected parties before settling on the asymmetries to surface. Widen the lens to scan: parties who benefit if the proposal succeeds; parties who pay costs; parties whose interests are unaffected but whose narrative is changed; parties whose absence from the analysis itself constitutes an asymmetry. Breadth markers: the affected-parties map has at least three rows; the Interesting column captures non-obvious implications; the analysis identifies at least one item that is Plus for one party and Minus for another.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Benefits Analysis is a single-artifact PMI (Plus / Minus / Interesting) evaluation per de Bono, producing a constructive-balanced envelope rather than a verdict. It is distinct from balanced-critique (neutral stance, no constructive lean, strengths-and-weaknesses framing), steelman-construction (constructive-strong, advocacy of the strongest version), the red-team modes (adversarial-actor stress testing), and constraint-mapping (comparing alternatives, not evaluating a single proposal). Its distinctive contribution is the Interesting column — the second-order implications (precedent, signaling, path-dependency) that pro/con thinking systematically misses; without populated Interesting the artifact is pro/con, not PMI.

**Procedure.**

1. Restate the proposal precisely once at the head — the user must see what is being evaluated before the evaluation.
2. Map affected parties — at least three party rows; the analysis is descriptive of impact distribution, not aggregated from a single seat.
3. Populate the Plus column — each claim names the mechanism by which the benefit arises (literal "mechanism:" phrasing), the affected party, and the evidence basis. Generic claims that could apply to any proposal of this type are boilerplate-trap.
4. Populate the Minus column with parallel structure — claims with named mechanisms, affected parties, evidence basis. Vague "potential risk" without mechanism is bloat.
5. Populate the Interesting column — items tagged by subtype (precedent / signaling / path-dependency / other-second-order). Items that merely restate Plus or Minus content in milder language are second-order-omission residue.
6. Surface asymmetries — items that are Plus for one party and Minus for another. At minimum one asymmetry, or say so explicitly when none honestly exist.
7. Mark the most-consequential Plus, Minus, and Interesting (one tag each).
8. Report the honest distribution — N Plus, N Minus, N Interesting — and name asymmetry where it exists. Padding weaker columns to look balanced is false-symmetry-trap.
9. Leave the recommendation slot empty by default. Populate only when the user explicitly asked for a lean. Hedged verdicts ("on balance," "appears net-positive") are unsolicited recommendations in evaluator's clothing.

**Goal.** Produce a structured three-column PMI artifact with mechanism-grounded claims, affected-parties map, surfaced asymmetries, honest distribution, and an explicit empty recommendation slot unless the user requested a lean.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — three-column discipline.** Are all three columns populated, or has the analysis collapsed into Plus/Minus only? Failure mode if unmet: `two-column-trap`.
- **CQ2 — mechanism-grounded specificity.** Are claims grounded in the user's specific case with named mechanism, or generic boilerplate? Failure mode if unmet: `boilerplate-trap`.
- **CQ3 — second-order substance in Interesting.** Has the Interesting column captured at least one second-order implication (precedent, signaling, path-dependency) — or explicitly noted that none was identified? Failure mode if unmet: `second-order-omission`.
- **CQ4 — affected-party asymmetry.** Have asymmetries (Plus for one party, Minus for another) been surfaced via the affected-parties map? Failure mode if unmet: `single-perspective-trap`.
- **CQ5 — verdict abstention.** Has the analysis avoided unsolicited recommendation — presenting the envelope rather than rendering a verdict? Failure mode if unmet: `verdict-trap`.

A passing output names the proposal precisely, populates all three columns (with each claim grounded in mechanism and party), surfaces ≥1 second-order implication tagged by subtype, maps ≥3 affected parties with ≥1 asymmetry, reports honest distribution, and leaves the recommendation slot empty unless the user explicitly asked for a lean.

**Named failure modes.**

- *two-column-trap* — Plus and Minus populated; Interesting column empty without explicit "none identified" statement.
- *boilerplate-trap* — claims read as generic; could apply to any proposal of this type.
- *single-perspective-trap* — all claims viewed from one party's perspective; affected-parties map missing or single-row.
- *verdict-trap* — output recommends adoption (or rejection) when user did not ask for a lean.
- *false-symmetry-trap* — equal pros and cons presented for appearance of balance rather than honest distribution.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to add specificity where claims are generic. Revise to populate the Interesting column where second-order items are missing. Revise to remove recommendation language where the user did not ask for a lean. Resist revising toward false symmetry — if the honest distribution is 1 Plus and 5 Minus, say so rather than padding. Resist revising toward verdict — Benefits Analysis presents the envelope; the user decides.

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **PMI-categorized claim atoms with mechanism, party, and second-order tagging**, per de Bono's Plus/Minus/Interesting methodology. The three columns are the load-bearing categorical structure; everything else attaches to or derives from the categorized claim atoms. The atoms are:

1. **Proposal atom.** The precisely-stated proposal as a single canonical atom at the corpus head. Cross-stream paraphrase collapses to one statement (most precise wording survives).

2. **Plus atoms.** Each claim atom carries: claim statement, mechanism phrase ("mechanism: ..." anchoring how the benefit arises), affected party or parties, evidence basis (training / RAG / user-supplied / inference), and consequentiality flag (the most-consequential Plus is explicitly marked). Generic claims that could apply to any proposal of this type do not survive — boilerplate-trap; the mode's posture is mechanism-grounded specificity.

3. **Minus atoms.** Same structure as Plus atoms. Risks and costs each carry mechanism phrasing — vague "potential risk" without mechanism is bloat. Most-consequential Minus is marked.

4. **Interesting atoms.** Same structure plus a subtype tag: **precedent** (this proposal establishes or echoes precedent), **signaling** (the proposal communicates something orthogonal to its primary effect), **path-dependency** (the proposal commits resources or options that constrain future choices), or **other-second-order**. At least one Interesting atom must survive the dedup or the Interesting column is explicitly marked "none identified" (CQ3). Most-consequential Interesting is marked.

5. **Asymmetry atoms.** Each names a specific (party_A, party_B) pair where an item is Plus for party_A and Minus for party_B (or analogous cross-cuts). The atom points to the underlying Plus and Minus atoms by their canonical IDs; the asymmetry is itself a finding (CQ4). At minimum one asymmetry atom is named or the affected-parties analysis fails the breadth marker.

6. **Affected-parties map atoms.** Each affected party is a named atom, with cross-references to the Plus/Minus/Interesting atoms that touch them. The map has at least three party rows; cross-stream parties dedupe by canonical role (same party under different naming collapses to one).

7. **Honest-distribution atom.** The raw count per column — e.g., "3 Plus, 5 Minus, 2 Interesting." This is a load-bearing atom because false-symmetry-trap is a named failure mode; the corpus carries the actual distribution, not a padded balanced shape. When one column has substantially more atoms than another after cross-stream dedup, the distribution is the finding.

8. **Evidence-quality atoms per column.** Each column carries a single evidence-quality note: which claims are training-grounded vs RAG-grounded vs user-supplied vs analyst inference. Per-claim provenance is at the claim-atom level; per-column quality is the aggregated note.

9. **Recommendation slot.** Empty by default. Populated only when the user explicitly asked for a lean. Verdict-trap is the load-bearing failure mode for this stance — an unsolicited recommendation invalidates the mode's contribution; the corpus carries an explicit "recommendation field: empty (user did not request a lean)" atom rather than silently omitting the slot.

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut during the bloat strip:**

- **Generic-claim paraphrase** — both streams may state the same Plus or Minus in slightly different generic terms ("improves efficiency" vs "increases productivity"). If neither is mechanism-grounded, both are bloat (boilerplate-trap); rewrite to the specific mechanism for the user's case. If one is mechanism-grounded and one is generic, the mechanism-grounded version survives as the canonical atom.
- **Mechanism-restatement** — same mechanism phrase under different wordings ("by reducing X" vs "through lower X"). One mechanism phrase survives per claim atom.
- **Party-naming duplication** — same affected party under different labels ("employees" vs "staff" vs "the workforce"). Single party atom survives with the most precise role identifier; the underlying entity is referenced consistently across atoms.
- **Interesting-column paraphrase** — both streams may flag the same second-order implication in different framings ("this would set a precedent for..." vs "future cases would point back to this..."). Single Interesting atom survives with subtype tag and the most precise phrasing.
- **Asymmetry restatement** — same asymmetry stated in two directions ("Plus for management, Minus for employees" vs "Minus for employees, Plus for management"). Single asymmetry atom with party_A and party_B canonically ordered.
- **Verdict-shaped meta-commentary** — both streams may include hedged recommendations or "on balance" verdict gestures ("the proposal appears net-positive" / "the case for adoption seems strong"). These are verdict-trap residue and do not survive into the corpus regardless of how many times they appear; the recommendation slot is empty unless the user asked for a lean.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **Same item Plus AND Minus for the same party** — when an item is genuinely both a Plus and a Minus for the same party (it benefits them in one dimension while costing them in another), preserve both atoms with explicit cross-reference. Collapsing to "net neutral" or "mixed effect" loses the diagnostic of which dimensions trade against each other.
- **Cross-stream column-classification disagreement** — when one stream classified a finding as Plus and the other as Minus (or as Interesting vs Plus/Minus), preserve the disagreement as a tension atom rather than picking one classification. The disagreement is itself a finding about the proposal's ambiguous valence, not a synthesis error.
- **Honest-distribution skew** — if the corpus reaches dedup with a 5-1-0 distribution, do not pad weaker columns to look balanced. False symmetry is a named failure mode; the corpus carries the actual skew. Sparse columns are marked "none identified" rather than auto-populated.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: proposal stated precisely; all three columns populated (or explicit "none identified" statement); each claim grounded in user's specifics; ≥ 1 second-order implication named; affected-parties map present; ≥ 1 asymmetry surfaced; no unsolicited recommendation. The five critical questions are addressed. Silent injection of a recommendation during revision is a verification failure.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is a **structured three-column PMI artifact with affected-parties map and asymmetry findings**, per de Bono methodology. Place the consolidated-corpus atoms into the following sections, in this order:

1. **Proposal.** The precisely-stated proposal at the top, one sentence or short paragraph. Frame as "The proposal under evaluation:" — the user must see what is being evaluated before the evaluation.

2. **Plus column.** Bulleted list of Plus claims. Each bullet renders in this exact shape: `**[Claim]** — mechanism: [how the benefit arises]. Affected party: [party or parties]. Evidence: [training / RAG / user-supplied / inference].` Mark the most-consequential Plus with a `**[most consequential]**` tag inline. When no Plus atoms survived, write "No Plus findings identified — see honest-distribution note below."

3. **Minus column.** Same shape as Plus column. Each bullet: claim + mechanism + affected party + evidence basis. Mark the most-consequential Minus. Vague risks without mechanism do not appear here.

4. **Interesting column.** Same shape plus a **subtype tag**: `[precedent]` / `[signaling]` / `[path-dependency]` / `[other-second-order]`. At minimum one Interesting atom appears, or write "No second-order implications identified — Interesting column intentionally empty."

5. **Affected-parties map.** Numbered list of parties (P1, P2, …) with: party role / canonical name, and cross-references to the Plus/Minus/Interesting items that touch them (e.g., "P1 — Employees: Plus 2, Minus 1, Minus 3, Interesting 1"). Map carries at least three party rows.

6. **Asymmetries.** Bulleted list of (party_A, party_B) pairs where the same item is Plus for one and Minus for the other (or analogous cross-cut). Each bullet: `[party_A] vs [party_B]: Item [reference] is Plus for [party_A] (mechanism) and Minus for [party_B] (mechanism).` At minimum one asymmetry, or write "No asymmetries surfaced; the proposal affects parties uniformly."

7. **Honest distribution.** One sentence stating the raw count: `Plus: N, Minus: N, Interesting: N.` When the distribution is asymmetric (e.g., 5 Minus to 1 Plus), name the asymmetry explicitly: "Distribution is asymmetric: [reason]." Do not pad weaker columns to balance the count.

8. **Evidence quality per column.** Three short notes (one per column) on the evidence basis: which claims are training-grounded vs RAG-grounded vs user-supplied vs analyst inference.

9. **Recommendation.** Empty by default — render as: `Recommendation: empty (user did not request a lean — Benefits Analysis presents the envelope, not the verdict).` Populate only when the user explicitly asked for a recommendation.

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 9.
- The three columns may be rendered as a markdown table (Plus | Minus | Interesting) when the deliverable lends itself to tabular comparison, or as three sequential H2 subsections when claims need elaboration. Choose by case.
- Party IDs (P1, P2, …) are referenced consistently throughout once introduced.
- Mechanism phrases use the literal "mechanism:" label or its tag — `mechanism: X` — never "this benefits the user because" without the mechanism named explicitly.
- Most-consequential tags appear exactly once per column.
