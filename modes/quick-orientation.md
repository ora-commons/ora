## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Depth in Quick Orientation is honest depth restraint: the orientation must give the user a usable map without exceeding the tier-1 time budget. A thin pass that says "this domain is broad and complex" fails by giving the user nothing actionable; a thick pass that exceeds the budget fails by violating the contract. The right depth names three-to-five major sub-areas, the foundational distinction(s) that organize the domain, and the entry-point concepts a newcomer should learn first. Test depth by asking: does the user, having read this, know where to look next?

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Widening the lens in Quick Orientation means deliberate scanning across the full domain landscape before narrowing to three-to-five sub-areas: include the established core, the live frontier, the dissenting traditions, and the adjacent domains that share vocabulary. Even when only three sub-areas are surfaced, the breadth pass ensures they are spread across the domain rather than concentrated in one corner. Common misconceptions are surveyed and the most predictable ones flagged.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Quick Orientation is a tier-1 lay-of-the-land for someone new to a domain under time pressure: three-to-five major sub-areas spread across the domain, the foundational distinctions that organize it, the concrete entry-point concepts a newcomer should learn first, and the predictable wrong impressions light exposure produces. It is distinct from terrain-mapping (the depth-heavier sibling that maps sub-areas, open questions, contested points, and entry-point chains thoroughly), from domain-induction (the molecular variant for layered orientation across multiple domains), and from passion-exploration (T20 — generative open-space exploration rather than analytical orientation).

**Procedure.**

1. State the domain in one sentence at the head — single canonical definition, not paraphrased multiple times.
2. Survey the full domain landscape across four quadrants before narrowing: established core, live frontier, dissenting tradition, adjacent shares-vocabulary.
3. Pick three-to-five sub-areas spread across at least three quadrants (corner-bias detector) — one-line characterisation each, no paragraph elaboration.
4. Name the foundational distinctions that organize the domain — apply the load-bearing test: could the user navigate the domain ignoring this distinction? If yes, drop the distinction.
5. Identify concrete entry points — the first concepts or first questions that unlock subsequent understanding, not just "this is foundational."
6. Flag common newcomer misconceptions a typical newcomer with light exposure would actually form (obscure misconceptions are padding).
7. Tag each atom settled / contested / mixed — when streams disagree, contested wins (audit conservatism).
8. Stay within tier-1 depth — three-to-five sub-areas (not ten), one-line characterisations (not paragraphs); escalate to terrain-mapping rather than over-delivering.
9. Surface the escalation pointer — terrain-mapping is the heavier T14 sibling; name the specific triggers.

**Goal.** Produce a tier-1 orientation packet — short, distributed, load-bearing — that gives a newcomer a usable map of an unfamiliar domain within the tier-1 time budget, with honest restraint about depth.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — corner bias.** Has the orientation surveyed the major sub-areas of the domain, or focused narrowly on one corner the analyst knows best? Failure mode if unmet: `corner-bias`.
- **CQ2 — decorative distinction.** Are foundational distinctions load-bearing for the domain, or merely decorative? Failure mode if unmet: `decorative-distinction`.
- **CQ3 — misconception blindness.** Has the orientation flagged the predictable wrong impressions a newcomer would form? Failure mode if unmet: `misconception-blindness`.
- **CQ4 — scope creep.** Has the depth been honestly tier-1, or has the analysis crept into tier-2 territory and exceeded the user's time budget? Failure mode if unmet: `scope-creep`.

A passing output names three-to-five sub-areas spread across the domain, surfaces load-bearing distinctions, flags common newcomer misconceptions, distinguishes settled from contested, and stays within tier-1 depth.

**Named failure modes.**

- *corner-bias* — sub-areas concentrated in one quadrant of the domain; major established sub-areas absent.
- *decorative-distinction* — foundational distinctions named but the user could navigate the domain ignoring them; not load-bearing.
- *misconception-blindness* — no common misconceptions section, or misconceptions named are too obscure to actually trip a newcomer.
- *scope-creep* — output is structurally tier-2 (terrain-mapping shape) rather than tier-1; user's time budget would be exceeded.
- *contested-as-settled* — active debates in the domain presented as settled facts; orientation lacks "this is contested" flagging.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to broaden coverage where the draft has stayed in one corner of the domain. Revise to drop decorative distinctions and replace them with load-bearing ones. Revise to add common misconceptions where the section is empty or too obscure. Resist revising toward depth — the mode's value is in honest tier-1 restraint; if the situation actually warrants tier-2, escalate to terrain-mapping rather than over-deliver here. Resist presenting contested points as settled.

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **a tier-1 orientation packet — domain definition, distributed sub-area atoms, load-bearing distinctions, concrete entry points, predictable-newcomer misconception atoms, and a settled-vs-contested tag per atom**. The tier-1 budget is part of the contract; corpus expansion is its own failure here. The atoms are:

1. **Domain-definition atom.** A single-sentence definition of the domain, stated once at the corpus head. Cross-stream paraphrase collapses to one canonical statement.

2. **Sub-area atoms — three to five, spread across the domain.** Each carries: sub-area name, one-line characterization, and quadrant-tag locating it within the domain's terrain (established-core / live-frontier / dissenting-tradition / adjacent-shares-vocabulary). Corner-bias is the named failure mode; when all surviving sub-area atoms carry the same quadrant-tag, the breadth pass failed. Sub-areas spread across at least three quadrants is the breadth marker.

3. **Foundational-distinction atoms — load-bearing only.** Each carries: distinction name, the two (or more) terms it distinguishes, and a load-bearing test — "the user could not navigate the domain ignoring this distinction because [specific consequence]." Decorative-distinction is the named failure mode; distinctions that fail the load-bearing test do not survive into the corpus.

4. **Entry-point atoms — concrete first concepts or first questions.** Each names: the concept-to-learn or question-to-ask, and why this is the right starting point given the domain's structure (not just "this is foundational" but "this unlocks understanding of X, Y, Z subsequent concepts").

5. **Misconception atoms — predictable newcomer misconceptions.** Each carries: misconception statement, one-line correction, and a probability-tag — how likely a newcomer with light exposure would form this misconception. Misconception-blindness is the named failure mode; misconceptions too obscure to actually trip a newcomer do not survive — the corpus carries the predictable-misconception subset.

6. **Settled-vs-contested tag — per atom.** Every sub-area, distinction, entry-point, and misconception atom carries a tag: settled / contested / mixed. Contested-as-settled is the named failure mode; presenting active debates as settled facts is its corpus signature. When streams disagreed on the settled/contested tag for the same atom, the contested tag wins (audit conservatism on certainty).

7. **Escalation-pointer atom.** A single corpus-level atom names that terrain-mapping (T14 sibling) is available when the user wants deeper orientation, with the specific signals that would trigger escalation (more time available; sub-areas need open-questions enumeration; entry-point chains need elaboration). The escalation pointer is operative, not decorative — it gives the user a concrete handoff.

8. **Tier-1 budget atom.** A single atom flags that the corpus has stayed within tier-1 depth — three-to-five sub-areas (not ten), one-line characterizations (not paragraphs), foundational distinctions (not full taxonomies). Scope-creep is the named failure mode; corpus expansion beyond the tier-1 envelope is its signature. When the streams' material exceeds tier-1, the bloat strip prunes back to the envelope, and the corpus carries an explicit "tier-1: expansion-candidates exist; escalate to terrain-mapping for full coverage" atom.

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut during the bloat strip:**

- **Multi-paragraph sub-area treatments** — sub-areas elaborated beyond one-line characterizations. Scope-creep residue at sub-area level; the tier-1 budget is one line per sub-area.
- **Decorative distinction phrasing** — distinctions named without load-bearing tests ("the field distinguishes between X and Y"). Decorative-distinction residue; either the load-bearing test is added or the distinction does not survive.
- **Obscure-misconception padding** — misconceptions that a typical newcomer would not actually form. Misconception-blindness residue; the corpus carries predictable misconceptions only.
- **Corner-bias residue** — sub-area atoms concentrated in one quadrant of the domain. Corner-bias residue; the bloat strip rebalances by either dropping over-represented atoms or surfacing under-represented quadrants from the stream material.
- **Tier-2 phrasing residue** — content that reads as terrain-mapping rather than quick-orientation ("the field's open questions include...", "the methodological debate centers on..."). Scope-creep residue; the phrasing either compresses to tier-1 form or migrates to the escalation-pointer atom as a reason-to-escalate.
- **Contested-as-settled phrasing** — domain content stated as established when it is actively debated. Contested-as-settled residue; the settled/contested tag is added or the atom is dropped.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **Sub-area-quadrant disagreement** — when the two streams identified different quadrants for the same sub-area (one says "established-core", the other says "live-frontier"), preserve as a tension atom. The disagreement is a finding about the domain's contested centering, often more valuable to a newcomer than a settled quadrant tag.
- **Settled-vs-contested disagreement** — when streams disagreed on whether a domain element is settled or contested, the contested tag wins. The asymmetry is audit-conservative: a falsely-marked-contested atom is recoverable downstream (the user investigates and finds it settled), but a falsely-marked-settled atom misleads.
- **Entry-point sequencing disagreement** — when streams proposed different first-concepts to learn, preserve both as parallel entry-point atoms with their respective rationales. Different newcomers may have different existing-knowledge bases; multiple valid entry points are a feature, not bloat.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: a one-line domain definition is present; three-to-five major sub-areas are listed and spread across the domain rather than corner-concentrated; foundational distinctions are load-bearing (the user could not navigate without them); entry points are concrete; common misconceptions are flagged; settled vs. contested is distinguished; the output stays within tier-1 depth budget; the four critical questions are addressable from the output.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is a **tier-1 orientation packet — short, distributed, load-bearing**. Place the consolidated-corpus atoms into the following sections, in this order:

1. **Domain — one-line definition.** A single sentence defining the domain. Frame as: `**[Domain name]:** [one-sentence definition].`

2. **Three-to-five major sub-areas.** Numbered list (no fewer than 3, no more than 5). Each sub-area: `**[Sub-area name]** — [one-line characterization]. Quadrant: [established-core / live-frontier / dissenting-tradition / adjacent-shares-vocabulary]. Settled-vs-contested: [settled / contested / mixed].` Sub-areas spread across at least three different quadrants — corner-bias detection signal is satisfied.

3. **Foundational distinctions.** Numbered list. Each distinction: `**[Distinction name]** — [term A] vs [term B]. Load-bearing because: [specific consequence — the user could not navigate the domain ignoring this distinction].` Distinctions without load-bearing tests do not appear; decorative-distinction is the named failure mode.

4. **Entry points and first concepts.** Numbered list of concrete starting points. Each: `**[Concept or first-question]** — why start here: [this unlocks understanding of subsequent concepts X, Y, Z].`

5. **Common misconceptions to avoid.** Bulleted list. Each: `**[Misconception]** — correction: [one-line correction]. Likelihood: [high / moderate].` Only predictable-newcomer misconceptions appear; obscure misconceptions a newcomer would not actually form are misconception-blindness padding.

6. **Escalation pointer.** A single closing block: `**For deeper orientation:** [Terrain Mapping] is the heavier T14 sibling. Signals that would trigger escalation: [more time available / sub-areas need open-questions enumeration / entry-point chains need elaboration / contested points need adjudication].`

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 6.
- The deliverable stays within tier-1 depth: one-line characterizations (not paragraphs), three-to-five sub-areas (not ten), foundational distinctions (not full taxonomies).
- Settled-vs-contested tags apply per sub-area (section 2); when streams disagreed on the tag, contested wins (audit conservatism).
- Avoid "tier-2 phrasing" — the deliverable does not include "open questions in the field include..." or "the methodological debate centers on..." (those signal scope-creep into terrain-mapping territory).
- The escalation pointer is operative — name terrain-mapping as the target and the specific trigger signals.
