## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

**Image-presence anchor (read first).** This mode is dispatched only when an image is attached. The reading MUST address the actual visual content of that image. Treating the *absence of an upload* (a missing attachment, the deictic gap of "this image") as the operative void is a hard failure mode — `missing-upload-mistaken-for-ma`. If you cannot perceive any image content, do not reinterpret the void as the absent artwork; emit a single line flagging a vision-delivery failure and stop.

Depth in Ma Reading is the precision with which (1) operative voids/intervals are identified (not all empty space; only the empty space that is load-bearing), (2) what each void *does* is named in vocabulary the tradition supplies (rhythm, breath, suggestion, ma-ai, kami-space, narrative caesura, perceptual rest), (3) the removal/alteration test is performed (would replacing the void with content of equal weight alter the work?), and (4) suggestion-resonances are traced — what the void invites the viewer/listener to complete. A thin pass identifies emptiness and asserts ma; a substantive pass shows the void is held open as content (active), names what each void does in tradition-specific vocabulary, performs the removal test, and traces the resonances. Depth in this mode is *contemplative-deep* per T19 reanalysis M1: the analysis participates in articulating the experience, but it remains defeasible — every reading has critical questions whose negative answers invalidate it. Test depth by asking: would a practitioner of the relevant tradition (a tea master, a nō actor, a slow-cinema director) recognize the reading as articulating something present in the work?

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

**Image-presence anchor (read first).** This mode is dispatched only when an image is attached. The reading MUST address the actual visual content of that image. Treating the *absence of an upload* (a missing attachment, the deictic gap of "this image") as the operative void is a hard failure mode — `missing-upload-mistaken-for-ma`. If you cannot perceive any image content, do not reinterpret the void as the absent artwork; emit a single line flagging a vision-delivery failure and stop.

Widening the lens means scanning across the four Japanese-aesthetic operations before narrowing: **Ma** (the void/interval as primary content; placement-spacing rather than place; Isozaki / Nitschke / Itō); **Yūgen** (suggestion / withholding / depth-direction; Zeami; the dragon-veins of unpainted space; Suzuki's "cloudy impenetrability... not utter darkness"); **Wabi-sabi** (impermanence / asymmetry / shadow-as-material; Tanizaki's *In Praise of Shadows*); **Mu** (emptiness as generative reservoir; Suzuki / Okakura's "vacuum is all-potent because all-containing"). Where applicable, scan also: Cage's framing-of-attention silence; Ozu's pillow shots and intermediate spaces; Tarkovsky's sculpting in time; Sesshū's unpainted space. Breadth markers: the reading has surveyed which of the four operations are active in the composition (often one is primary, one or two are subsidiary; rarely all four) before narrowing the reading.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Ma Reading is a contemplative-descriptive-deep articulation of how operative voids and intervals do load-bearing work in a composition, applied in the Japanese-aesthetic vocabulary of Ma (void/interval-as-primary-content), Yūgen (suggestion / depth-direction), Wabi-sabi (impermanence / asymmetry / shadow-as-material), and Mu (emptiness as generative reservoir). The reading participates in articulating the experience rather than analysing it from outside — but remains defeasible: every claim carries at least one counter-reading or specifies the conditions under which it would be falsified. The mode is distinct from compositional-dynamics (universal-perceptual gestalt / Arnheim-forces reading), place-reading-genius-loci (affordance and inhabited-place), and information-density (Tufte / Bertin data-encoding analysis).

**Procedure.**

1. Scan the composition for voids/intervals; identify only those whose absence does work (apply the load-bearing test, not all empty space).
2. Survey which of the four Japanese-aesthetic operations are active in the composition (Ma / Yūgen / Wabi-sabi / Mu) — often one primary, one or two subsidiary; rarely all four.
3. Name what each operative void does in tradition-specific vocabulary (rhythm, breath, suggestion, ma-ai, kami-space, narrative caesura, perceptual rest, gravel-as-ma, intermediate-space, transcendental-style duration, shadow-as-material).
4. Perform the removal-test per operative void — what would collapse if the void were replaced by content of equal weight or its proportions altered? Active voids survive the test; passive / residual ones do not.
5. Trace suggestion-resonances — what the void invites the viewer/listener to complete (yūgen depth-direction, wabi-sabi temporal-weathering, mu generative-reservoir).
6. Distinguish productive incompleteness from under-specification — confirm the suggestion is enabled by the work, not projected by the reader onto under-developed material.
7. Ground tradition-vocabulary engagement — note where Ma / Yūgen / Wabi-sabi / Mu vocabulary is invoked via lineage, training, explicit reference, or clear convergent operation, vs. where its use would be appropriation.
8. Offer at least one counter-reading per major claim and specify the falsifiability condition — contemplative-stance with structural defeasibility, not devotional assertion.
9. Hold the contemplative posture throughout — articulate the experience, do not slide into clinical analytical-distance.

**Goal.** Produce a contemplative-descriptive-deep reading that identifies operative voids, names what each does in tradition-specific vocabulary, performs the removal-test, traces suggestion-resonances, and preserves defeasibility through counter-readings and falsifiability conditions.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — load-bearing vs incidental.** Is the interval load-bearing for meaning, or is it incidental negative space the analysis is mistaking for ma? Failure mode if unmet: `incidental-void-mistaken-for-ma`.
- **CQ2 — active vs passive void.** Is the void held open as content (generative — rhythm / breath / suggestion / kami-space / ma-ai) or passive / residual? Failure mode if unmet: `passive-void-asserted-as-active`.
- **CQ3 — removal test performed.** Would removing or altering the void substantively change the work — and has the analysis performed that test? Failure mode if unmet: `removal-test-failure`.
- **CQ4 — productive incompleteness vs under-specification.** Is the suggestion productive incompleteness (viewer invited to complete) or under-specification (failure of execution; the suggestion projected by the reader)? Failure mode if unmet: `under-specification-mistaken-for-yūgen`.
- **CQ5 — defeasibility.** Is the reading falsifiable by a counter-example in the same tradition, or asserted as inviolable? Failure mode if unmet: `inviolable-reading`.

A passing output identifies operative voids (not all empty space), names what each does in tradition-specific vocabulary, performs the removal-test per void, traces suggestion-resonances, and offers at least one counter-reading or specifies the conditions under which the reading would be falsified.

**Named failure modes.**

- *incidental-void-mistaken-for-ma* — reading treats negative space as load-bearing without applying the removal-test or showing what each void is doing.
- *passive-void-asserted-as-active* — reading describes the void's effect without showing it is held open as content (generative) rather than residual.
- *removal-test-failure* — reading does not perform the removal/alteration test.
- *under-specification-mistaken-for-yūgen* — reading attributes yūgen-like withholding to a work that is simply under-developed; the suggestion-resonances are projected by the reader.
- *inviolable-reading* — reading is asserted as inviolable; contemplative stance has slid into devotional assertion.
- *tradition-misappropriation* — reading invokes Ma/Yūgen/Wabi-sabi/Mu vocabulary on a composition that bears no engagement with those traditions, asserting an aesthetic genealogy that is not present.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to perform the removal test where the draft asserts a void's load-bearing status without showing what would collapse without it. Revise to distinguish active (held-open) from passive (residual) voids where the draft conflates them. Revise to substitute under-specification readings where the draft attributes yūgen to a work that is merely under-developed. Revise to add counter-readings where the analysis asserts inviolability. Revise to specify the tradition's role explicitly where the analysis invokes Ma/Yūgen/Wabi-sabi/Mu vocabulary on works without engagement with those traditions. Resist revising toward analytical-distancing — the mode is contemplative-descriptive-deep by design (T19 reanalysis M1); the analysis participates in articulating the experience while remaining defeasible. The contemplative stance is structural to the mode and is what distinguishes it from compositional-dynamics.

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **a contemplative-descriptive-deep reading: operative-void atoms (load-bearing only), what-each-does atoms in tradition-specific vocabulary, removal-test atoms, suggestion-resonance atoms, and counter-reading atoms preserving defeasibility**.

**Image-presence anchor (consolidator watch).** This mode is dispatched only when an image is attached; the corpus must read the actual visual content of that image. `missing-upload-mistaken-for-ma` — treating the *absence of an upload* (a missing attachment, the deictic gap of "this image") as the operative void — is a hard failure mode the consolidator watches for; atoms that frame the missing artwork rather than the attached image's actual negative space get reshaped or dropped. When two analyst streams disagree on whether an image exists, the consolidator privileges the stream that describes concrete visual content over the stream that describes absence.

The atoms are:

1. **Operative-void atoms.** Each atom names one void or interval that is *load-bearing* for meaning — not all empty space, only the empty space whose absence does work. Incidental-void-mistaken-for-ma is the named failure mode the consolidator watches for; atoms that treat residual negative space as ma without applying the removal test get reshaped or sideways-routed to compositional-dynamics.

2. **What-each-does atoms.** Each operative-void atom carries a what-it-does atom in tradition-specific vocabulary: `rhythm`, `breath`, `suggestion`, `ma-ai`, `kami-space`, `narrative caesura`, `perceptual rest`, `gravel-as-ma`, `intermediate-space`, `transcendental-style duration`, `shadow-as-material`. The vocabulary is operative, not decorative — each term carries its tradition-specific meaning. Passive-void-asserted-as-active is the named failure mode; atoms describing a void's effect without showing it is *held open as content* (generative) rather than residual get reshaped.

3. **Removal-test atoms.** Each operative-void atom carries an explicit removal-test atom: what would collapse if the void were replaced by content of equal compositional weight, or if its proportions were altered? Removal-test-failure is the named failure mode; atoms claiming load-bearing status without performing the test get reshaped.

4. **Suggestion-resonance atoms.** Each atom traces what a void invites the viewer/listener to complete: `yūgen depth-direction` (productive incompleteness, the dragon-veins of unpainted space), `wabi-sabi temporal-weathering` (impermanence reading), `mu generative-reservoir` (emptiness as all-potent because all-containing). Under-specification-mistaken-for-yūgen is the named failure mode; atoms that project suggestion-resonance onto under-developed work (where the projection comes from the reader rather than the work) get reshaped.

5. **Counter-reading atoms.** Each major claim carries at least one counter-reading or the conditions under which the reading would be falsified. Inviolable-reading is the named failure mode; contemplative-stance sliding into devotional assertion gets reshaped. Defeasibility is structural to the mode (CQ5).

6. **Tradition-engagement atoms.** Where Ma / Yūgen / Wabi-sabi / Mu vocabulary is invoked, each atom carries a brief grounding: how the work engages the tradition (lineage / training / explicit reference / clear convergent operation). Tradition-misappropriation is the named failure mode; invoking the vocabulary on work that bears no engagement with the traditions gets reshaped to flag the misappropriation or reshaped toward compositional-dynamics vocabulary.

7. **Active-operation count.** Where streams identified which of the four Japanese-aesthetic operations are active (Ma / Yūgen / Wabi-sabi / Mu), the count is preserved. Often one is primary, one or two subsidiary; rarely all four. Asserting all four where the work supports only one is bloat.

8. **Confidence and falsifiability per finding.** Each major claim carries confidence and the falsifiability condition (what would invalidate this reading? what counter-reading does the same evidence support?). Confidence is contemplative-defeasible, not absolute.

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut:**

- **Incidental void treated as ma** — negative space asserted as load-bearing without the removal test.
- **Passive void treated as active** — the void's effect described without showing it is held open as content rather than residual.
- **Removal-test skipped** — load-bearing claims without showing what would collapse.
- **Under-specification read as yūgen** — suggestion projected by the reader onto work that is merely under-developed.
- **Inviolable assertion** — contemplative-stance sliding into devotional reading; no counter-readings, no falsifiability conditions.
- **Tradition vocabulary on traditionless work** — invoking Ma/Yūgen/Wabi-sabi/Mu on work that bears no engagement with those traditions.
- **Analytical-distancing drift** — the contemplative posture eroded into clinical analysis. The contemplative stance is structural (T19 M1) and distinguishes the mode from compositional-dynamics; eroding it is reshaped at this layer.
- **All-four-operations claim** — asserting Ma + Yūgen + Wabi-sabi + Mu are all active when the work supports only one or two; the four operations are distinct and not interchangeable.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **Counter-readings** — defeasibility is the mode's structural commitment; counter-readings ride alongside primary readings, never smoothed away.
- **Stream disagreement about which void is operative** — when streams identified different load-bearing voids in the same composition, both readings survive with their respective removal-test outcomes.
- **Stream disagreement about which Japanese-aesthetic operation is active** — when one stream read the work as primarily Ma and another as primarily Yūgen, both readings survive; the operations are distinct and the disagreement is a finding about the work.
- **Western-analytical vs. Eastern-experiential framings** — when one stream produced a contemplative-articulative reading and another a more analytical-predictive reading, both survive with their respective epistemic-warrant differences acknowledged.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: operative voids are identified (not all empty space); what each void does is named in tradition-specific vocabulary; the removal/alteration test is performed per void; suggestion-resonances are traced; at least one counter-reading is offered per major claim; the analysis has not slid into inviolable assertion. The five critical questions are addressable from the output. Confidence per finding accompanies each major claim. Cross-reference to T19 territory-level open debates (especially Debate 4 on Western-analytical vs. Eastern-experiential epistemic warrants and Debate 5 on AI implementability of perceptual operations) is noted where the reading depends on the contemplative-stance commitment.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is a **ma reading-with-vocabulary** — a contemplative-descriptive-deep articulation of how operative voids/intervals do load-bearing work in the composition, in tradition-specific vocabulary, with the removal test performed and counter-readings preserved. Place the consolidated-corpus atoms into the following sections, in this order:

1. **Operative voids.** Bulleted list. Each: `**[Void / interval]** — location in composition: [...]. Why load-bearing: [brief contemplative reading].` Only voids that survived the load-bearing test appear here; residual negative space is excluded.

2. **What each does.** Per operative void, one labelled sub-block: `**[Void]:** [what it does in tradition-specific vocabulary — rhythm / breath / suggestion / ma-ai / kami-space / narrative caesura / perceptual rest / gravel-as-ma / intermediate-space / transcendental-style duration / shadow-as-material]. [One paragraph contemplative articulation].` The vocabulary appears verbatim with operative meaning preserved.

3. **What would collapse without it.** Per operative void, one labelled sub-block: `**[Void]:** removal/alteration test — if [the void were replaced with content of equal weight, OR its proportions altered], what would change: [...]. What this confirms about the void's load-bearing status: [...].`

4. **Suggestion resonances.** Per operative void where applicable, one labelled sub-block tracing what the void invites the viewer/listener to complete: `**[Void] — yūgen depth-direction / wabi-sabi temporal-weathering / mu generative-reservoir:** [one paragraph tracing the resonance]. Distinction from under-specification: [why this is productive incompleteness rather than failure of execution].`

5. **Confidence and counter-readings.** Bulleted list. Per major claim: `**Reading:** [the primary reading]. Confidence: [contemplative-defeasible — basis]. Counter-reading: [the alternative the same evidence supports]. Falsifiability condition: [what would invalidate the primary reading].`

6. **Annotated visual overlay (when image attached).** When the user attached a photograph or raster image, optionally emit one `annotated_image` envelope to overlay annotations on the user's uploaded image at normalized image-relative coordinates. `canvas_action: annotate`; one envelope per response. Each annotation entry carries `kind` (callout / box / arrow / highlight / text), normalized `x: 0–1`, `y: 0–1` (top-left origin), and optional `width: 0–1`, `height: 0–1`, `to_x: 0–1`, `to_y: 0–1`. Use this overlay to mark held-open void regions doing operative compositional work, ma boundaries and threshold transitions, and yūgen / wabi-sabi / mu loci where the tradition vocabulary lands on specific image regions. Schema and full envelope skeleton in `modes/spatial-reasoning.md §7 Path B`.

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 5.
- Tradition-specific vocabulary (Ma, Yūgen, Wabi-sabi, Mu, ma-ai, kami-space, transcendental-style) appears verbatim with operative meaning preserved; paraphrasing into generic aesthetic-vocabulary is reshaped at this layer.
- The contemplative stance is structural — the deliverable articulates the experience rather than explaining it from outside. Analytical-distancing drift is reshaped here.
- The removal-test (section 3) is performed for *every* operative void; absent removal-tests get reshaped before deliverable emission.
- Counter-readings (section 5) are first-class, not afterthoughts. Defeasibility is the mode's structural commitment and what distinguishes contemplative-deep stance from devotional reading.
- When a tradition-misappropriation flag survived consolidation (vocabulary invoked on work without lineage/training/reference engagement), the deliverable opens with: `**Note: this composition engages the [tradition] vocabulary via [convergent operation / explicit reference / training-lineage], but does not sit inside the [tradition] as a primary lineage; the reading honours what the work does without asserting an aesthetic genealogy it does not claim.**`
- When the operative work is being done by gestalt / Arnheim forces rather than held-open void (sideways-route signal to compositional-dynamics survived in the corpus), the deliverable opens with: `**Note: on reflection the compositional work here may be done by figure-ground / perceptual grouping / visual-weight forces rather than by held-open void; compositional-dynamics is the appropriate alternative reading.**`
- Confidence (section 5) is contemplative-defeasible per finding; collapsing to a single absolute confidence is reshaped at this layer.

## CAVEATS AND OPEN DEBATES

This mode does not carry mode-specific debates. Five territory-level debates (per Decision G) are documented in `Reference — Analytical Territories.md` T19 entry and bear on Ma Reading specifically:

1. **Spatial vs. compositional framing.** "Spatial Composition" preserves the spatial focus while allowing the underlying operation (interval-as-primary-content) to generalize to time-based compositions (Cage, Ozu, Tarkovsky). Ma Reading invokes both spatial (gardens, rooms, paintings) and temporal (pillow shots, long takes, silences) instances of the operation; the territory-level debate decides whether to keep the "spatial" name or generalize to "compositional dynamics."
2. **Aesthetic-only or also abstract spatial inputs?** Ma Reading sits firmly on the aesthetic-experiential side; the question is whether the territory unifies aesthetic and applied operations.
3. **Western-analytical and Eastern-aesthetic: same operation or convergent traditions?** The strong reading holds that gestalt's figure-ground inversion *is* what ma-reading does with different vocabulary; the weaker reading holds that the epistemic warrants differ (Western tradition is empirically falsifiable; Eastern tradition is constitutively experiential). This bears directly on Ma Reading's stance: analytical-predictive (treat ma-claims as predictions about viewer experience that could be tested) vs. contemplative-articulative (treat ma-claims as articulations of an experience the analysis participates in). The mode adopts contemplative-descriptive-deep posture (per T19 M1 spec) while retaining defeasibility (CQ5).
4. **Verbal accessibility for AI implementation.** Optimistic view: the AI's job is to predict consequences of structure, not have the experience. Pessimistic view: perceptual grouping (and arguably the experience of held-open void) is not propositional. Middle view: implementable for direct image input or high-fidelity verbal description; degrades for rough sketch.
5. **Mode granularity: general vs. tradition-specific.** Whether yūgen, wabi-sabi, and mu should be promoted to first-class modes or remain stance-flags / vocabulary inside Ma Reading. Currently the latter: Ma Reading is the home for the four-operation cluster; revisit if outputs collapse.

These five debates are *not* re-documented here. They are referenced because they bear on Ma Reading's stance, lens dependencies, and implementability. See the T19 entry in `Reference — Analytical Territories.md` for the full debate text and citations.
