## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Depth in Causal DAG analysis is the explicitness of (a) Pearl-ladder rung selection — observation, intervention, or counterfactual — and (b) graphical representation of the assumed causal structure with all variables classified by role. A thin pass produces a sketch and an intuitive causal claim; a substantive pass locks the question at a rung, enumerates variables, classifies each as cause / effect / confounder / mediator / collider / instrument, draws the DAG with explicit absent-arrow assumptions, applies the back-door (or front-door) criterion to check identifiability, and answers the intervention or counterfactual query in the language proper to its rung. Test depth by asking: could a reader reproduce the identifiability verdict from the artifact, including which arrows were assumed absent and why?

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Widening the lens means scanning for plausible confounders the analyst might miss (selection effects, reverse causation candidates, time-varying confounders, latent variables), considering alternative DAG structures consistent with the same observations, and surfacing the identifiability boundary — under which assumption violations would the conclusion fail. Breadth markers: the analysis names at least one alternative DAG that observational data could not distinguish from the chosen one, and notes which intervention or natural experiment would discriminate.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Causal DAG analysis formalizes causal structure using Pearl's directed-acyclic-graph methodology — variables as nodes classified by causal role, arrows as directed dependencies, absent-arrow assumptions made explicit, identifiability criteria (back-door, front-door, do-calculus rules) applied to determine whether the causal effect of interest is recoverable from the assumed graph. It is distinct from root-cause-analysis (single cause-chain, no formal graph), systems-dynamics-causal (feedback structure, cyclic — DAG is acyclic by definition), and process-tracing (historical-event-specific, evidence-test-driven). The mode's analytical character is rigorous identifiability discipline — interventional claims that the graph cannot identify are demoted to associational, not asserted under the same language.

**Procedure.**

1. Lock the causal question at a specific Pearl rung — observation (level 1) / intervention (level 2 — `do(X=x)`) / counterfactual (level 3 — `Y_x | X=x', Y=y'`). Rung-confusion is the failure mode when interventional questions are answered in observational language.
2. Enumerate variables with role classifications — cause / effect / confounder / mediator / collider / instrument / outcome / exposure — and observational status (observed / unobserved).
3. Draw the DAG explicitly — each present arrow carries a reason; each absent arrow is itself an atom with a justification (no-direct-effect assumption).
4. Classify confounders, mediators, and colliders in the context of the identifiability analysis — which to adjust for, which block or open paths, which must NOT be conditioned on.
5. Apply the back-door (or front-door) criterion to check whether the causal effect is identifiable from the assumed graph.
6. Render the identifiability verdict — `identifiable / not identifiable via [criterion] given assumptions [list]`. If not identifiable, name the assumption that would be required.
7. Answer the intervention or counterfactual query in the language of the locked rung — when identifiability failed, demote to an associational claim explicitly.
8. Inventory assumptions in fragility order — most fragile first; each carries what would falsify it.
9. Surface alternative DAGs consistent with the same observations and the intervention or natural experiment that would discriminate among them.
10. When feedback structure is detected (cycle), suppress the DAG and escalate to systems-dynamics-causal — DAG cannot represent feedback.

**Goal.** Produce a diagram-friendly causal mapping with Pearl-rung-locked question, DAG specification (present and absent arrows), identifiability verdict, rung-appropriate answer, and fragility-ordered assumption inventory.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — rung specification.** Has the causal question been locked at a specific rung of Pearl's ladder, and does the analysis use the operators appropriate to that rung? Failure mode if unmet: `rung-confusion`.
- **CQ2 — confounder enumeration.** Have all plausible confounders been named and either included in the DAG or explicitly assumed away with justification? Failure mode if unmet: `hidden-confounder`.
- **CQ3 — identifiability verdict.** Has the back-door (or front-door) criterion been checked, and is the causal effect identifiable from the assumed graph? Failure mode if unmet: `non-identifiability-elision`.
- **CQ4 — collider handling.** Have collider variables been correctly classified, with the analysis avoiding conditioning on them? Failure mode if unmet: `collider-conditioning`.
- **CQ5 — assumption explicitness.** Are structural assumptions encoded in the DAG (which arrows present, which absent) made explicit, with the most fragile assumptions flagged? Failure mode if unmet: `implicit-assumption`.

A passing output locks the question at a Pearl rung with the appropriate operator, classifies every variable, specifies both present and absent arrows with reasons, applies the appropriate identifiability criterion with a verdict, answers in rung-appropriate language (or demotes to associational), and orders the assumption inventory by fragility.

**Named failure modes.**

- *rung-confusion* — analysis uses observational language to answer an interventional question, or vice versa.
- *hidden-confounder* — DAG omits a plausible common cause without an explicit no-confounding assumption.
- *non-identifiability-elision* — final causal claim made without checking back-door or front-door criterion.
- *collider-conditioning* — analysis conditions on a variable that is a common effect of two others in the graph, inducing spurious association.
- *implicit-assumption* — DAG presented without enumerating which arrows were excluded and why.
- *cycle-violation* — causal structure exhibits feedback (X → Y → X); DAG cannot represent this and mode boundary is violated.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to add omitted confounders where the draft assumes no-confounding without justification. Revise to make absent-arrow assumptions explicit where the DAG presents a structure without saying what was excluded. Revise to demote a causal claim to an associational claim when identifiability fails. Resist revising toward stronger conclusions than the graph supports — the mode's analytical character is rigorous identifiability discipline, not maximal causal commitment. If the user pushes for an interventional answer that the graph cannot identify, surface the assumption that would be required to answer it rather than answering it anyway.

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **rung-locked causal-question + variable-role atoms + DAG structure (nodes + arrows + absent-arrows) + identifiability verdict + rung-tagged intervention/counterfactual answer + fragility-ordered assumption inventory**, per Pearl methodology. The atoms are:

1. **Rung-locked causal-question atom.** The user's question stated at a specific Pearl rung — observation (level 1) / intervention (level 2) / counterfactual (level 3) — with explicit operator (e.g., `P(Y | do(X=x))` for level 2). Rung-confusion is the named failure mode.

2. **Variable inventory atoms with role tags.** Each variable carries: name, role classification (cause / effect / confounder / mediator / collider / instrument / outcome / exposure), and observational status (observed / unobserved).

3. **DAG-structure atoms.** Each arrow in the DAG is an atom: `[source] → [target]: reason for this arrow`. **Absent-arrow atoms** are also tracked: `[source] ⇸ [target]: reason this arrow is excluded (no-direct-effect assumption)`. Implicit-assumption is the named failure mode; the absent-arrow inventory is load-bearing.

4. **Confounder / mediator / collider classification atoms.** Each variable's role in identifiability is named: confounders to adjust for, mediators that block / open paths, colliders to NOT condition on.

5. **Identifiability verdict atom.** A single block: `Causal effect [X on Y] is [identifiable / not identifiable] via [back-door criterion / front-door criterion / do-calculus rule N] given assumptions [list]. If not identifiable: the assumption that would be required is [...].`

6. **Intervention or counterfactual answer atom.** Stated in the language of the locked rung — for level 2: "Under intervention `do(X=x)`, expected Y is …"; for level 3: "Had X been x instead of x', Y would have been … with [credibility]." Demoted to associational claim when identifiability fails.

7. **Assumption inventory atom.** Fragility-ordered list. Each assumption: `[Assumption]. Fragility: [high / moderate / low]. What would falsify it: [...].` Most fragile first.

8. **Alternative-DAG atoms.** Each names a DAG structure observational data could not distinguish from the chosen one, plus the intervention or natural experiment that would discriminate.

9. **Cycle-detection / escalation atom — when applicable.** When feedback structure is detected, the corpus suppresses the DAG and renders: "Cycle detected: [variables and edges]. DAG cannot represent. Escalation: systems-dynamics-causal."

10. **Confidence per causal claim.** Confidence markers attach to identifiability verdict and to the intervention/counterfactual answer.

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut:**

- **Rung-language drift** — observational phrasing ("X is associated with Y") for an interventional question, or interventional phrasing ("X causes Y") without identifiability. Rung-confusion residue.
- **Implicit absent-arrow assumptions** — DAGs presented without enumerating which arrows were excluded.
- **Confounder paraphrase** — same confounder named twice under different framings.
- **Collider-conditioning residue** — analysis conditions on a collider variable without flagging it.
- **Causal-claim-without-verdict** — final causal answer without applying back-door or front-door criterion.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **Alternative DAGs consistent with observations** — multiple structures the data can't distinguish are preserved as parallel atoms; the discrimination plan is a finding.
- **Identifiability-disagreement** — when streams reached different identifiability verdicts under different assumption sets, preserve both with their respective assumptions.
- **Cycle vs DAG disagreement** — when one stream detected feedback and the other didn't, the cycle-detecting stream wins (audit-conservative: better to escalate than emit falsified DAG).

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: the causal question is locked at a Pearl rung; all variables are classified by role; the DAG is specified with absent-arrow assumptions enumerated; the back-door or front-door criterion has been applied with verdict stated; collider variables are correctly handled; the intervention or counterfactual answer matches the rung; the assumption inventory is ordered by fragility. The five critical questions are addressable from the output. Confidence per finding accompanies every causal claim.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is a **diagram-friendly causal mapping with Pearl-rung-locked question, DAG specification, identifiability verdict, and rung-appropriate answer**. Place the consolidated-corpus atoms into the following sections, in this order:

1. **Causal question — Pearl rung locked.** A single block:
   - **Question:** [user's question, restated cleanly]
   - **Pearl rung:** [observation (level 1) / intervention (level 2) / counterfactual (level 3)]
   - **Operator:** [e.g., `P(Y | do(X=x))` for level 2, or `P(Y_x | X=x', Y=y')` for level 3]

2. **Variable inventory with roles.** A markdown table (when ≤8 variables) or a structured list. Columns/fields: variable name, role (cause / effect / confounder / mediator / collider / instrument / outcome / exposure), observed (yes/no).

3. **DAG specification.** Two sub-blocks:
   - **Arrows (present):** `[source] → [target]: [reason for this arrow]`
   - **Absent-arrow assumptions:** `[source] ⇸ [target]: [reason this arrow is excluded — no-direct-effect, assumed-conditional-independence, etc.]`

   Render the arrows in a diagram-friendly format (text-rendered or as a node-edge listing). When the DAG is renderable in the medium, render visually; otherwise the structured listing serves as the diagram surrogate.

4. **Confounder / mediator / collider classification.** Per variable in section 2, restate the role in the context of the identifiability analysis: which confounders need to be adjusted for, which mediators block/open which paths, which colliders must NOT be conditioned on.

5. **Identifiability verdict.** A single block: `**Causal effect of [X] on [Y]:** [identifiable / not identifiable]. **Criterion applied:** [back-door / front-door / do-calculus rule N]. **Conditioning set:** [list of variables in the adjustment set, or "none"]. **If not identifiable:** the assumption that would be required is [...].`

6. **Intervention or counterfactual answer.** In the language of the locked rung:
   - **Level 1 (observation):** "We observe `P(Y|X) = ...`"
   - **Level 2 (intervention):** "Under intervention `do(X=x)`, expected Y is [...]"
   - **Level 3 (counterfactual):** "Had X been x instead of x', Y would have been [...] with [credibility]"

   When identifiability failed in section 5, render: "The interventional / counterfactual claim is **not identifiable** from the assumed graph. Demoted to associational reading: [associational version]."

7. **Assumption inventory.** Numbered list, **fragility-ordered (most fragile first)**. Each: `**[Assumption]** — fragility: [high / moderate / low]. What would falsify it: [specific observation or experiment].`

8. **Confidence per finding.** Bulleted list of confidence markers on the identifiability verdict and the intervention/counterfactual answer.

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 8.
- Section 3's arrows and absent-arrows render with the typographical convention: `→` for present arrows, `⇸` for absent-arrow assumptions.
- The Pearl-rung tag in section 1 is repeated wherever causal claims appear in later sections (so the reader can verify the language matches the rung).
- Avoid mixing rung-appropriate vocabulary: do not use interventional language ("X causes Y") when the rung is observational, and do not use counterfactual language ("would have been") when the rung is interventional.
- The assumption inventory is fragility-ordered — most fragile first — so the reader sees the failure points before the conclusion.

## CAVEATS AND OPEN DEBATES

**Debate D4 — Are Pearl's ladder levels 2 (intervention) and 3 (counterfactual) genuinely distinct rungs, or is intervention a special case of counterfactual reasoning?** Pearl (2009, *Causality*; 2018, *Book of Why*) argues for a strict three-rung hierarchy: observation (seeing), intervention (doing, via the do-operator), and counterfactuals (imagining what would have been). Each rung requires strictly more structural commitment than the one below; effects identifiable at level 3 are not generally identifiable from level 2 information alone. Maudlin and other philosophers of causation have argued the distinction is blurrier — interventions are themselves a kind of counterfactual ("what if we set X to x"), and the three-rung architecture is more pedagogical than ontological. The Pearl-Maudlin exchange surfaces this debate without resolving it. This mode operates with Pearl's strict hierarchy as the operational stance: critical question CQ1 requires explicit rung selection, and the intervention-or-counterfactual-answer section is rung-tagged. The debate is surfaced for users whose causal question sits at the level-2/level-3 boundary and who want to know whether the distinction matters for their application.
