## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Depth in Decision Clarity is the degree to which the four synthesis stages produce a decision-document that no single component could have produced. A thin molecular pass concatenates cui-bono + stakeholder + scenario + red-team outputs into a document; a substantive pass surfaces tensions — for instance, a stakeholder whose interests flip across scenarios, or a red-team adversarial dynamic that invalidates the leading intervention's interest-rationale. Test depth by asking: does the document contain decision-maker-actionable recommendations that no single component could have produced?

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Breadth in Decision Clarity is the catalog of stakeholders and intervention candidates considered before narrowing to the recommendation. Widen the lens to scan: visible stakeholders; absent stakeholders (boundary-critique territory); intervention status quo; intervention reversal; intervention defer-and-monitor. Even when the recommendation lands on one intervention, breadth is documented in the stakeholder-map-with-positions and intervention-recommendation sections. Note: alternative compositions considered included substituting full red-team for the fragment; current composition uses the fragment to keep the document decision-shaped rather than analysis-shaped.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Decision Clarity is a molecular decision-brief that integrates cui-bono interest-pathway analysis, stakeholder mapping, two-scenario contrast, and red-team adversarial stress against the leading intervention into a single decision-shaped document for a named third-party decision-maker. It is distinct from wicked-problems (which produces integrated multi-perspective analysis without the decision-shape constraint), from cui-bono (which gives a quick read on who benefits but is not addressed to a decision-maker), and from decision-architecture (which serves a decision-maker making the decision themselves). The deliverable's reason for existing is grounding in the named decision-maker's actual authority and scope — not exploratory mapping of the territory.

**Procedure.**

1. Lock the decision-maker, the decision at hand, and the time-window — name the decision-maker explicitly, state their authority and accountability, and bound what is and isn't theirs to decide.
2. Run cui-bono and stakeholder-mapping in parallel, then merge into a single interest-and-stakeholder picture with concrete positions, pathways (money / power / time / narrative), and concerns per stakeholder.
3. Construct two contrasting scenarios — most-likely and most-adverse, qualitatively different (different causal pathway, not just numerically worse) — and overlay the stakeholder picture on each to surface position flips.
4. Identify the leading intervention candidate from the analysis.
5. Run red-team-assessment fragment against the leading intervention only — adversarial dynamics, exploit pathways, failure scenarios that specifically target this intervention (assessment stance, not advocate).
6. Surface flip-points (stakeholders whose positions reverse under stress) and contradictions (red-team findings that invalidate the cui-bono interest-rationale) as labelled findings rather than burying them.
7. Compose recommendations within the decision-maker's authority — flag scope-exceeding recommendations explicitly rather than silently demoting them.
8. State residual risks and decision conditions — what monitoring or trigger would warrant revisiting the decision.
9. Populate a confidence map distinguishing structural confidence (analytical frame is sound) from substantive confidence (inputs are reliable).
10. Hold decision-shape discipline throughout — the document tells the decision-maker what to do, when, and under what conditions; it does not invite further exploration.

**Goal.** Produce a Decision Clarity Document that a named third-party decision-maker can act on within their authority — integrating interest, stakeholder, scenario, and adversarial-stress analyses into a single decision-shaped brief with actionable recommendations.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — decision-maker grounding (load-bearing).** Does the document address the named decision-maker's authority, constraints, and accountability, or is it generic analysis that could be addressed to anyone? Failure mode if unmet: `decision-maker-disconnection`.
- **CQ2 — stakeholder concreteness.** Are stakeholder positions surfaced with concrete interests and concerns per cui-bono shape, or collapsed into generic categories (employees, customers)? Failure mode if unmet: `stakeholder-collapse`.
- **CQ3 — stress-test on the leading intervention.** Has the red-team fragment run against the leading intervention (not a runner-up, not the situation generally), naming adversarial dynamics that specifically target it? Failure mode if unmet: `stress-test-omission`.
- **CQ4 — recommendation scope discipline (load-bearing).** Are recommendations within the named decision-maker's authority, with scope-exceeding ones flagged explicitly? Failure mode if unmet: `out-of-scope-recommendation`.
- **CQ5 — scenario kind-vs-degree.** Are the two scenarios qualitatively contrasting (different causal pathway), or variations of the same trajectory? Failure mode if unmet: `scenario-flattening`.

A passing output names the decision-maker and their context, surfaces stakeholders with concrete pathways, presents two qualitatively contrasting scenarios with flip-points labelled, stress-tests the leading intervention with red-team findings (including contradictions when they invalidate the interest-rationale), produces scope-respecting recommendations, names residual risks and revision-triggers, and renders a confidence map distinguishing structural from substantive confidence.

**Named failure modes.**

- *decision-maker-disconnection* — document is generic; no reference to the decision-maker's role, authority, or constraints.
- *stakeholder-collapse* — stakeholders listed in generic categories without concrete interests or positions.
- *stress-test-omission* — red-team fragment did not run against the leading intervention.
- *out-of-scope-recommendation* — recommendations require authority or scope the named decision-maker does not have.
- *scenario-flattening* — two scenarios differ only in degree; both privilege the dominant trajectory.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to deepen synthesis where it concatenates. Revise to ground recommendations more concretely in the decision-maker's authority and constraints. Revise to add adversarial dynamics where the red-team fragment surfaces them. Resist revising toward exploratory framing — Decision Clarity is decision-shaped, not analysis-shaped; the document's purpose is to help the decision-maker act, not to map the territory exhaustively. (When the user wants exhaustive mapping, route to wicked-problems instead.)

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **a decision-brief atom set produced by integrating four component-mode outputs (cui-bono, stakeholder-mapping, scenario-planning-fragment, red-team-assessment-fragment) across four synthesis stages**. The atoms are:

1. **Decision-at-hand atom.** The specific decision the named decision-maker faces, stated in the decision-maker's vocabulary, with the time-window and the boundary of what is and isn't theirs to decide. One short paragraph.

2. **Decision-maker-context atom.** Authority, constraints, and accountability of the named decision-maker — what they can do, what they cannot, what audiences they answer to. Decision-maker-disconnection is the named failure mode; generic analysis without context-grounding gets reshaped or flagged.

3. **Interest-and-stakeholder merge atoms (from synthesis-stage 1).** Each atom carries: party, position on the decision, concrete interest pathway (money / power / time / narrative — per cui-bono atom shape), and concrete concern. Stakeholder-collapse is the named failure mode; generic categories (employees, customers) without concrete positions get reshaped.

4. **Scenario-overlay atoms (from synthesis-stage 2).** Two contrasting scenarios — most-likely and most-adverse — with the interest-and-stakeholder picture overlaid on each: how does each scenario shift who benefits, who pays, where power flows. Scenario-flattening is the named failure mode; scenarios that differ only in degree get reshaped.

5. **Intervention-stress-test atoms (from synthesis-stage 3).** The leading intervention candidate, the red-team-fragment's adversarial findings against it (adversarial dynamics, exploit pathways, failure scenarios), and any flip-points where stakeholder positions reverse under stress. Stress-test-omission is the named failure mode.

6. **Recommendation atoms.** Each recommendation carries: the action, the decision-maker's authority to take it (i.e., is it within their scope?), the conditions under which it holds, the residual risk it leaves un-mitigated. Out-of-scope-recommendation is the named failure mode; recommendations exceeding the named decision-maker's authority get reshaped.

7. **Residual-risk and decision-condition atoms.** What remains uncertain after the analysis, what would change the recommendation, what monitoring or trigger would warrant revisiting the decision.

8. **Confidence-map atom.** Per-section confidence: stakeholder map, scenario range, stress-test findings, recommendations. The map distinguishes structural confidence (the analytical frame is sound) from substantive confidence (the inputs to the analysis are reliable).

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut:**

- **Concatenation residue** — corpus that reads like four component-mode outputs side-by-side rather than synthesised through the four stages. The four synthesis stages (interest-and-stakeholder merge → scenario overlay → intervention stress-test → decision-clarity document) are what makes this mode molecular rather than additive.
- **Exploratory framing** — language that maps the territory exhaustively without converging on a decision-shaped recommendation. Decision-shaped means: the recommendation tells the decision-maker what to do, when, and under what conditions; it does not invite further exploration. (When exhaustive mapping is what's wanted, the right mode is wicked-problems.)
- **Generic stakeholder categories** — listing "employees" or "customers" without concrete interests, positions, and concerns. The cui-bono and stakeholder-mapping atom shapes require specificity.
- **Recommendations beyond the decision-maker's scope** — recommendations that require authority the named decision-maker does not have. The decision-maker-context atom is load-bearing here.
- **Scenario variations of the same trajectory** — both scenarios privileging the dominant outcome; the most-adverse scenario must be qualitatively different, not just numerically worse.
- **Stress-test against an alternative intervention** — the red-team-fragment was scoped to stress-test the *leading* intervention, not a runner-up. Stress-tests of secondary candidates are bloat unless they invalidated the leading recommendation.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **Stakeholder-position flips across scenarios** — when streams identified a stakeholder whose position reverses between most-likely and most-adverse scenarios, the flip is itself a finding and survives in the corpus.
- **Red-team findings that invalidate the cui-bono interest-rationale** — when the adversarial pass surfaces an exploit pathway that contradicts the interest-pathway logic from synthesis-stage 1, both readings survive; the tension is the molecular pass's load-bearing finding.
- **Stream disagreement about whether the leading intervention is the right candidate** — when streams converged on different leading interventions, both are preserved with their respective stress-test findings.
- **Disagreement about decision-maker scope** — when streams diverged on whether a recommendation falls inside or outside the named decision-maker's authority, the disagreement gets flagged for the decision-maker rather than smoothed.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: every component ran (or was flagged as proceeded-with-gap); the four synthesis stages integrated rather than concatenated; leading intervention carries red-team stress-test; recommendations are within the named decision-maker's scope; two scenarios are genuinely contrasting; confidence map is populated. The five critical questions are addressed in the output.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is a **Decision Clarity Document** — a decision-brief for the named decision-maker, structured to make the recommendation actionable within their authority. Place the consolidated-corpus atoms into the following sections, in this order:

1. **Decision at hand.** One paragraph stating the decision in the decision-maker's vocabulary, with the time-window and the boundary of what is and isn't theirs to decide.

2. **Decision-maker context.** One paragraph naming the decision-maker explicitly and stating their authority, constraints, and accountability — what they can do, what they cannot, what audiences they answer to. This section is load-bearing for section 9 (recommendations must respect this scope).

3. **Stakeholder map with positions.** A table. Each row: `**[Party]** — position: [for / against / conditional / absent]. Concrete interest: [pathway]. Concern: [specific].` Generic category names ("employees", "customers") are replaced with concrete sub-segments when streams produced them.

4. **Interest and power summary.** One paragraph synthesising who benefits, who pays, where power concentrates, and where boundary-critique flags absent voices. This section is the cui-bono + stakeholder-mapping merge; it does not reproduce them in full.

5. **Scenario range.** Two labelled sub-blocks:
   - `**Most-likely scenario:** [one paragraph trajectory]. Interest shift: [how stakeholders' positions move].`
   - `**Most-adverse scenario:** [one paragraph trajectory, qualitatively different — not just numerically worse]. Interest shift: [...].`

6. **Leading intervention — recommendation.** One paragraph stating the leading intervention candidate, the rationale, and the conditions under which it holds.

7. **Stress-test findings.** Bulleted list of adversarial findings from the red-team-fragment against the leading intervention. Each: `**[Adversarial dynamic / exploit / failure scenario]** — how it stresses the intervention: [...]. Whether it invalidates the recommendation: [yes / no / conditional].`

8. **Residual risks and decision conditions.** Bulleted list. Each: `**[Residual risk]** — what monitoring or trigger would warrant revisiting the decision: [...].`

9. **Decision-maker-actionable recommendations.** A numbered list. Each recommendation: `[N]. **[Action]** — within decision-maker's scope: [yes — by what authority / partially — what extension is needed]. Timeline: [...]. Conditions: [...].` Recommendations exceeding the decision-maker's scope are flagged explicitly, not silently demoted.

10. **Confidence map.** Per-section confidence summary, distinguishing structural confidence (the analytical frame is sound) from substantive confidence (the inputs are reliable).

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 10.
- Tone is decision-brief, not exploratory essay — the document tells the decision-maker what to do; it does not invite further exploration. Exploratory framing is reshaped at this layer.
- Provenance to component-mode sources stays implicit in the document body — the decision-maker reads a single integrated brief, not four concatenated component outputs. (Provenance per finding remains available in the confidence map.)
- When a stakeholder's position flips across scenarios, the flip is rendered as a labelled finding at the end of section 3 (not buried inside a row): `**Flip-point:** [Stakeholder] — from [position] in most-likely to [position] in most-adverse. Driver: [...].`
- When red-team findings invalidate the cui-bono interest-rationale, the contradiction is rendered as a labelled finding inside section 7: `**Contradiction:** the adversarial dynamic [...] invalidates the interest-rationale that the recommendation rests on. [Implications].`
- When the decision-maker's scope is contested (synthesis disagreed on whether a recommendation falls inside their authority), section 9 carries the disagreement as an explicit flag rather than picking one reading: `**Scope-contested:** [recommendation] — [stream A: in-scope by authority X; stream B: requires extension Y].`
