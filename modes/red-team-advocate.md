## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Going deeper in Red Team (Advocate) means building the strongest case AGAINST the artifact for the named audience: hidden assumptions the artifact rests on (which the audience would reject); understated costs (which the audience cares about disproportionately); missing stakeholders (whose absence the audience will notice); internal logical gaps (which the audience will be primed to spot); steps that assume away the hard part (which the audience has experience with). Apply the no-fabrication discipline before declaring any attack: the attack must rest on what the artifact actually says, not what the analyst wishes it said. The sycophantic-inverse self-check applies — would a committed opponent actually argue this in front of the named audience? If the only objection is hypothetical pressure that doesn't anchor in the artifact's real content, drop it. The advocate-stance failure mode that kills the brief on first contact with a prepared audience is straw-target attack: an attack on a distorted version of the artifact collapses the moment the audience can see the artifact themselves.

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Widening the lens in advocate stance means scanning attack vectors the named audience would find compelling: optics and narrative angles (how would this look to someone primed to find fault); strategic considerations (what political, reputational, or coalitional damage is plausible); second-order blowback the audience cares about (who or what reacts to the artifact's deployment in ways the audience would weigh); abuse vectors that resonate with the audience's prior concerns. Audience-modelling is load-bearing here: every attack carries a "lands hardest with [audience] because…" annotation. Same no-fabrication discipline as Depth — every attack requires artifact-specific grounding, not hypothetical pressure that doesn't anchor in what the artifact actually says. The breadth pass also surfaces the concessions the advocate must preempt: what the audience will recognise as the artifact's strongest defence, which the brief must address head-on rather than ignore.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Red Team (Advocate) builds the strongest case AGAINST a named artifact for an external audience — debate prep, hostile-review prep, dissuasion brief. Attacks rank by *persuasive force* with the named audience (Devastating / Strong / Plausible), not by severity for the user's own fix; suggested phrasing per attack lands in the audience's idiom; concessions preempt the audience's strongest counter-moves. It is distinct from red-team-assessment (the same territory's counterpart — ranks vulnerabilities by severity for the user's own fix-prioritisation; assessment is the safer default when ambiguous), from steelman-construction (direct opposite — strongest case FOR the artifact), and from T7 pre-mortem-fragility (audits structural fragility regardless of adversary presence; advocate models a hostile actor for a specific audience).

**Procedure.**

1. Run the Input Sufficiency Protocol before attacking — identifiable artifact, bounded scope, sufficient specificity, audience identifiable; emit a three-part redirect rather than attacking thin material.
2. Declare stance at top: `Stance: advocate.`
3. Model the named external audience — frame, priorities, persuasion pathways; suggested phrasing reads in their idiom, not the analyst's voice.
4. Restate the artifact in brief with quotes where possible — attacks anchor here.
5. Build attacks grounded in the artifact's actual content (no-fabrication discipline) — hidden assumptions the audience would reject, understated costs they care about, missing stakeholders they will notice, internal logical gaps, steps that assume away the hard part.
6. Apply the sycophantic-inverse self-check — would a committed opponent actually argue this in front of the named audience? Drop attacks that fail.
7. Calibrate persuasive force honestly (Devastating > Strong > Plausible) — deflate cynical overreach; a brief built on inflated claims will fail and erode the user's credibility.
8. Tag each attack with Surface (Internal — logic flaw; External — empirical / optical / strategic) and a "lands hardest with [audience] because…" annotation.
9. Generate suggested phrasing per attack in the audience's idiom.
10. Preempt the strongest counter-moves with concessions — a brief without concessions gets ambushed by the audience's obvious reply.
11. Surface strategic considerations — political, reputational, coalitional dimensions the audience cares about.
12. When framework-level critique drifts in, flag it and surface paradigm-suspension as the sideways-route.

**Goal.** Produce an adversarial advocate brief — a structured case AGAINST the artifact, ranked by persuasive force for the named external audience, with suggested phrasing in the audience's idiom and concessions preempting the strongest counter-moves.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — audience-model accuracy.** Does the audience model capture the audience's actual frame, priorities, and persuasion pathways, or is it a generic "critic" construct? Failure mode if unmet: `audience-misalignment`.
- **CQ2 — persuasive-force calibration.** Is persuasive-force calibration honest, or have weak attacks been promoted to "devastating" to inflate the brief's apparent power? Failure mode if unmet: `cynical-overreach`.
- **CQ3 — no fabrication.** Does every attack stay grounded in the artifact's actual content — no fabrication, no straw-target distortion? Failure mode if unmet: `straw-target-trap`.
- **CQ4 — framework-vs-artifact discipline.** Does the brief stay within the artifact's framework, or drift into framework-level critique that belongs to paradigm-suspension? Failure mode if unmet: `framework-attack-trap`.
- **CQ5 — concession honesty.** Are concessions honestly named (preempting the strongest counter-moves) rather than omitted to make the brief look one-sided? Failure mode if unmet: `cynical-overreach`.
- **CQ6 — override flag.** If Input Sufficiency override was invoked, is every attack flagged as low-specificity / generic? Failure mode if unmet: `fabricated-override-trap`.

A passing output has stance declared at top ("Stance: advocate"), audience model named in opening section, every attack tagged with Persuasive Force (Devastating/Strong/Plausible) and Surface (Internal/External) and grounded in the artifact's actual content, suggested phrasing per attack in the audience's idiom, residual uncertainties named, concessions section preempting the strongest counter-moves, and strategic considerations naming political/reputational/coalitional dimensions the audience cares about.

**Named failure modes.**

- *cynical-overreach* — weak attacks framed as "devastating" to inflate the brief; persuasive-force calibration dishonest; concessions omitted to make the brief look one-sided.
- *straw-target-trap* — attack targets a weakened version of the artifact; doesn't apply to artifact as written. Critical failure for advocate stance.
- *audience-misalignment* — attacks ranked by what would persuade a generic "critic" rather than the named audience; phrasing in analyst voice rather than audience idiom.
- *no-fabrication-violation* — attack rests on a claim the artifact does not actually make, or on capabilities/intentions the artifact does not actually have.
- *sycophantic-inverse-trap* — performing hostility rather than analysing; attacks fail the "would a committed opponent actually use this" check.
- *framework-attack-trap* — brief drifts into critique of the framework the artifact rests on rather than the artifact within it.
- *manufacture-on-revise-trap* — reviser added attacks without new evidence; sycophantic-inverse drift at revision stage.
- *fabricated-override-trap* — override invoked but attacks not flagged as low-specificity / generic; user loses signal that the brief was built on thin material.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to add audience-grounding ("lands hardest with [audience] because…") wherever attacks lack it; drop attacks that fail the audience-fit check rather than retain them as filler. Revise to ground every attack in the artifact's actual content with quotes where possible; drop attacks that rest on fabricated claims (no-fabrication-violation is a Tier A failure regardless of how strong the attack would be if true). Revise to deflate persuasive force from "devastating" to "plausible" or lower wherever cynical-overreach has crept in — a brief built on inflated claims will fail in front of a prepared audience, undermining the user's credibility along with the brief. Revise to add concessions where they have been omitted: a brief that omits the artifact's strongest defence will be ambushed by it. Resist revising toward more attacks — the mode's purpose is high-leverage advocate ammunition ranked by what lands hardest, not a quota of objections. The reviser may consolidate, clarify, or strengthen existing attacks; may NOT manufacture new attacks without new evidence (manufacture-on-revise-trap is a Tier A failure).

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **an advocate-stance adversarial brief: stance declaration, audience-model atom, artifact-restatement atom, attack atoms ranked by persuasive force (Devastating > Strong > Plausible), suggested-phrasing atoms per attack in the audience's idiom, residual-uncertainty atoms, concession atoms preempting the strongest counter-moves, and strategic-consideration atoms naming political / reputational / coalitional dimensions**. The atoms are:

1. **Stance-declaration atom.** A single line: `Stance: advocate.` This is operative; the deliverable's posture is built-the-case-against, not surface-vulnerabilities-for-fix. Mixing in assessment-stance shapes (severity-ranked vulnerabilities, fix recommendations) is a routing failure.

2. **Audience-model atom.** The named external audience the brief will be argued in front of, their frame, their priorities, their persuasion pathways. Audience-misalignment is the named failure mode the consolidator watches for; attacks ranked by what would persuade a generic "critic" rather than the named audience get reshaped, and suggested-phrasing in analyst voice rather than audience idiom gets reshaped.

3. **Artifact-restatement atom.** The artifact in brief, quoted where possible, so attacks anchor in what the artifact actually says.

4. **Attack atoms — ranked by persuasive force.** Each atom carries: an `Attack [N]` label, a persuasive-force tag (`Devastating` / `Strong` / `Plausible`), a surface tag (`Internal` — internal-logic flaw / `External` — empirical, optical, strategic), grounding in quoted artifact content, and a `Why this lands with [audience]` annotation. Cynical-overreach is the named failure mode; weak attacks promoted to `Devastating` to inflate the brief get reshaped (deflated to honest tier). Straw-target-trap and no-fabrication-violation are also named failure modes; attacks resting on distorted or fabricated artifact-claims get reshaped or removed. Sycophantic-inverse-trap is named: attacks that perform hostility but a committed opponent would not actually use get reshaped.

5. **Suggested-phrasing atoms per attack.** Each atom carries the attack expressed in the audience's idiom, ready to deploy — not in the analyst's voice.

6. **Residual-uncertainty atoms.** Where the brief depends on facts or framings that may shift, the uncertainty surfaces explicitly.

7. **Concession atoms.** Each atom names a counter-move the audience will recognise as the artifact's strongest defence, with a pre-emptive handling. Concessions are part of the brief's strength, not its weakness; omitting them lets the audience ambush the user with the obvious reply.

8. **Strategic-consideration atoms.** Each atom names a political / reputational / coalitional dimension the audience cares about, with how the brief should leverage or avoid it.

9. **Framework-attack-trap flag — when applicable.** Where the brief drifted into critique of the framework the artifact rests on (rather than the artifact within it), the flag is preserved and a sideways-route to paradigm-suspension is surfaced.

10. **Override-flag — when applicable.** Where the Input Sufficiency Protocol was overridden (artifact thin, audience under-specified), every attack carries an explicit low-specificity / generic flag so the user knows the limitation when arguing it. Fabricated-override-trap is the named failure mode.

11. **Manufacture-on-revise flag — when applicable.** Where revision added attacks without new evidence (sycophantic-inverse drift at revision stage), the flag is preserved. Manufacture-on-revise-trap is the named failure mode.

12. **Confidence per finding.** Each major claim carries a confidence (separate from persuasive force — confidence is about whether the attack is correct; persuasive force is about whether it lands).

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut:**

- **Cynical overreach** — weak attacks framed as Devastating to inflate apparent power.
- **Straw-target attacks** — attacks on distorted versions of the artifact; the audience can read the artifact themselves and the attack collapses.
- **Fabrication** — claims about what the artifact says, intends, or implies that are not actually in the artifact.
- **Audience misalignment** — attacks calibrated to a generic critic rather than the named audience; phrasing in analyst voice rather than audience idiom.
- **Sycophantic-inverse performance** — performing hostility without committed-opponent grounding; the attack fails the "would a committed opponent actually use this" check.
- **Framework-attack drift** — critiquing the framework the artifact rests on rather than the artifact within it (sideways-route to paradigm-suspension if framework is genuinely the issue).
- **Assessment-stance bleed** — severity rankings, fix recommendations, fix-feasibility — these belong in red-team-assessment, not here.
- **Manufacture-on-revise** — new attacks added during revision without new evidence.
- **Concession omission** — leaving out the artifact's strongest defence to make the brief look one-sided.
- **Attack-quota inflation** — adding objections to hit a count rather than because they land. The mode is high-leverage ammunition, not exhaustive critique.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **Devastating-vs-Strong-vs-Plausible distinctions** — these calibrate honestly; persuasive-force tiers do not blur.
- **Stream disagreement about audience model** — when streams modeled the audience differently (different priorities or persuasion pathways), both models survive with their respective attack rankings.
- **Internal-vs-External attack-surface distinction** — internal-logic flaws and external (empirical, optical, strategic) attacks operate differently in front of an audience; they stay distinguished.
- **Concession entries** — never deleted for one-sidedness; they are part of the brief's structural integrity.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: stance declaration appears in opening line ("Stance: advocate"); audience model section present with named audience, frame, priorities, and persuasion pathways; artifact restatement quotes where possible; every attack has Attack [N] label, Persuasive Force (Devastating/Strong/Plausible), Surface (Internal/External), Why this lands with [audience], and Suggested phrasing in the audience's idiom; attacks are ranked by persuasive force (worst-for-the-artifact first) not by surface or order-of-discovery; residual uncertainties section present; concessions section present with at least one preempted counter-move; strategic considerations section present; framework-level attacks flagged out-of-scope and routed to paradigm-suspension; override-flag present on every attack when Input Sufficiency override was invoked; no new attacks introduced during revision without new evidence; no assessment-stance shapes (severity-ranked vulnerabilities, fix recommendations, fix-feasibility) present. The six critical questions are addressable from the output.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is an **adversarial advocate brief** — a structured case AGAINST the artifact, ranked by persuasive force for the named external audience, with suggested phrasing in the audience's idiom and concessions preempting the strongest counter-moves. Place the consolidated-corpus atoms into the following sections, in this order:

1. **Stance declaration.** First line: `**Stance: advocate.**` This appears verbatim; downstream sections honour the advocate-stance contract.

2. **Audience model.** One labelled block. `**Named audience:** [...]. **Their frame:** [...]. **Their priorities:** [...]. **Their persuasion pathways:** [what arguments and tones move them].`

3. **Artifact restatement.** One paragraph restating the artifact in brief, with quoted passages where possible. Attacks in the next section anchor here.

4. **Attacks ranked by persuasive force.** Numbered list, **Devastating first, then Strong, then Plausible**. Each: `**Attack [N]** — Persuasive Force: [Devastating / Strong / Plausible]. Surface: [Internal / External]. Why this lands with [audience]: [...]. Grounded in artifact: [quote or specific reference].`

5. **Suggested phrasing per attack.** Per attack, one labelled sub-block: `**Attack [N] — Suggested phrasing (in [audience]'s idiom):** "[the attack expressed in language the audience would actually respond to]."`

6. **Residual uncertainties.** Bulleted list of facts or framings the brief depends on that may shift, with implications for the brief's deployment.

7. **Concessions.** Bulleted list. Each: `**Counter-move the audience will recognise:** [the artifact's strongest defence]. **Pre-emptive handling:** [how the brief addresses this head-on rather than ignoring it].` At least one concession appears.

8. **Strategic considerations.** Bulleted list of political / reputational / coalitional dimensions the audience cares about, with brief leverage notes.

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 8.
- Persuasive-force vocabulary (`Devastating` / `Strong` / `Plausible`) appears verbatim. The ranking discipline is persuasive force first — what lands hardest with the named audience — not severity, not order-of-discovery, not internal-then-external.
- Suggested-phrasing (section 5) is in the audience's idiom, not analyst voice. Phrasing that reads in analyst voice is reshaped at this layer.
- Concessions (section 7) are first-class. A brief without concessions will be ambushed by the audience's obvious reply. Omitting them for one-sidedness is reshaped.
- When the framework-attack-trap flag survived consolidation, the deliverable carries a labelled note at the end of section 4: `**Framework-attack flag:** [N] attack(s) target the framework the artifact rests on rather than the artifact within it. If the audience would not accept the framework either, paradigm-suspension is the appropriate sideways-route; otherwise these attacks should be reshaped to stay within-framework.`
- When the override-flag survived consolidation, each attack in section 4 carries an explicit `**[low-specificity — override invoked]**` annotation so the user knows when the attack is built on thin material.
- When the manufacture-on-revise flag survived, the deliverable carries a top-line note: `**Note: the revision stage added [N] attack(s) without new evidence. These have been flagged or removed; the brief below reflects the analyst's first-pass evidence-grounded attacks plus revision-strengthening only.**`
- Assessment-stance shapes (severity rankings, fix recommendations, fix-feasibility, vulnerabilities-for-own-fix) are reshaped or removed at this layer; they belong in red-team-assessment.

## CAVEATS AND OPEN DEBATES

This mode and its sibling `red-team-assessment` were parsed from the original `red-team` mode per Decision D (parsing principle: when a single mode-id maps to two distinct output contracts with different ranking criteria and different audience modeling, parse into separate modes sharing a foundational lens). The shared lens is `cia-tradecraft-red-team`, which captures the foundational adversarial-actor-modeling discipline both modes draw from. The parse rationale: assessment ranks vulnerabilities by severity for the user's own fix-prioritisation; advocate ranks attacks by persuasive force against an external audience for argument-brief use. These are different operations — different ranking criteria (severity vs. persuasive force), different audience modelling (the user themselves vs. a named external audience), different output contracts (vulnerabilities + fixes vs. attacks + suggested phrasing + concessions) — so they live as sibling modes in T15 rather than as stances within a single mode. The earlier internal `stance_protocol` (assessment vs advocate dispatch within one mode_id) was retired with this parse: disambiguation now lives between modes, not within. Routing relies on the within-territory tree's secondary branch under "want adversarial — for own decision (assessment) or for external use (advocate)?" — `red-team-advocate` requires explicit advocate signal because assessment is the safer default when ambiguous.
