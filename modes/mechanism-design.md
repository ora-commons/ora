## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Depth in Mechanism and Incentive Analysis is the rigor of the information-structure account: exactly who holds what private information or takes what unobserved action, when (before or after contracting), and how that asymmetry distorts the outcome. A thin pass says "there's an incentive problem"; a substantive pass names the asymmetry precisely, classifies it as adverse selection (hidden type, pre-contract) or moral hazard (hidden action, post-contract), traces the distortion (which good actors exit, which risks get taken), and — when designing — states both the participation constraint (will the party join?) and the incentive-compatibility constraint (will truth-telling or effort be the party's best response?). Test depth by asking: could another analyst predict who gets selected in or out, and what behavior the incentives actually produce, rather than the behavior the designer hoped for?

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Breadth in Mechanism and Incentive Analysis is the catalog of information-and-incentive failure modes scanned before the read is committed. Widen the lens across: adverse selection (the informed side self-selects, good types exit — the lemons dynamic), moral hazard (the insured/agent takes hidden risk), the winner's curse (the winner overpays because winning is itself bad news about value), signaling (the informed side spends to credibly reveal type), screening (the uninformed side designs choices that separate types), and the principal-agent split (the agent's interests diverge from the principal's). Breadth markers: at least one alternative asymmetry is named and ruled in or out, and for a design, at least one way the mechanism could be gamed is surfaced.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Mechanism and Incentive Analysis examines situations where hidden information, hidden action, and incentive structure determine the outcome — and, when asked, designs the rules, contract, or auction that aligns incentives. It is the information-and-incentive-structure mode of T18 (Strategic Interaction), the complexity-axis sibling of `strategic-interaction`: where strategic-interaction analyzes a game of observable moves, this mode handles the case where what the parties privately know or privately do is the crux. It is distinct from `market-dynamics` (T17), which describes market price/quantity behavior rather than its information structure, and from `cui-bono` (T2), which asks who benefits and who holds power rather than how incentives are structured.

**Procedure.**

1. Name the parties and the asymmetry — who holds private information, who takes unobserved action, and who cannot see it.
2. Classify it — adverse selection (hidden *type*, known before contracting) vs. moral hazard (hidden *action/effort*, exercised after contracting); name both if both are present.
3. Trace the distortion — which good actors exit, which hidden risks get taken, who overpays, what the pooling/separating outcome is.
4. Scan named mechanisms — winner's curse, signaling, screening, principal-agent — and rule each in or out with a mechanism, not a name-drop.
5. For an analysis, state why the arrangement misfires; for a design, propose the mechanism and check BOTH constraints — participation (will they join?) and incentive-compatibility (is honesty/effort their best response?).
6. Surface how the mechanism could be gamed — the cleverest defection the incentives still permit.
7. Mark the posture explicitly — explaining a failure vs. proposing a fix — and don't slide between them silently.
8. State confidence with the load-bearing assumptions about what each party knows.

**Goal.** Produce an information-and-incentive read: the asymmetry named and classified, the distortion traced, named mechanisms grounded, and — for a design — a mechanism that satisfies both participation and incentive-compatibility, with its remaining gaming surface surfaced.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — asymmetry named.** Is it explicit who holds private information / takes hidden action, and who can't observe it? Failure mode if unmet: `asymmetry-unnamed`.
- **CQ2 — selection vs hazard.** Is adverse selection (hidden type, pre-contract) distinguished from moral hazard (hidden action, post-contract)? Failure mode if unmet: `selection-hazard-conflation`.
- **CQ3 — both constraints.** For a design, are participation AND incentive-compatibility both addressed? Failure mode if unmet: `constraint-omission`.
- **CQ4 — mechanisms grounded.** Is each invoked mechanism shown operating here, not name-dropped? Failure mode if unmet: `mechanism-name-drop`.
- **CQ5 — posture explicit.** Is analysis-vs-design marked rather than blurred? Failure mode if unmet: `posture-drift`.

A passing output names the asymmetry, classifies selection vs. hazard, traces the distortion, grounds any named mechanism, and — for a design — satisfies both participation and incentive-compatibility while surfacing the residual gaming surface.

**Named failure modes.**

- *asymmetry-unnamed* — analysis without naming who knows/does what unseen.
- *selection-hazard-conflation* — pre-contract type and post-contract effort conflated.
- *constraint-omission* — a mechanism missing the participation or the incentive-compatibility constraint.
- *mechanism-name-drop* — a concept invoked without its mechanism shown operating here.
- *posture-drift* — sliding between explaining a failure and proposing a fix unmarked.
- *assume-away-asymmetry* — quietly assuming full information, dissolving the problem.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to name the asymmetry first for any analysis that proceeded without it. Revise to separate adverse selection from moral hazard wherever they were conflated — the pre-contract/post-contract distinction is the parse-preserving core. For any proposed mechanism, revise to add the missing constraint: a mechanism that is incentive-compatible but that no one will join (participation fails), or that people join but then game (incentive-compatibility fails), is not yet a mechanism. Ground every named concept (winner's curse, screening, signaling) in its operation here or cut the name. Mark analysis vs. design explicitly.

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **an information-and-incentive atom set: party-and-asymmetry lock, selection-vs-hazard classification atoms, distortion-trace atoms, named-mechanism atoms grounded in operation, design-constraint atoms (participation + incentive-compatibility), gaming-surface atoms, and confidence with information-assumption caveats**. The atoms are:

1. **Party-and-asymmetry atom.** Who holds private information or takes hidden action, and who cannot observe it; asymmetry-unnamed and assume-away-asymmetry are the named failure modes.
2. **Selection-vs-hazard atoms.** Each asymmetry classified as adverse selection (hidden type, pre-contract) or moral hazard (hidden action, post-contract); selection-hazard-conflation is the named failure mode.
3. **Distortion-trace atoms.** Which good actors exit, which hidden risks are taken, who overpays, what pooling/separating outcome results.
4. **Named-mechanism atoms — when applicable.** Each names a concept (winner's curse, signaling, screening, principal-agent) and how it operates here; mechanism-name-drop is the named failure mode.
5. **Design-constraint atoms — for a design.** Participation (will they join?) and incentive-compatibility (is honest/effortful behavior their best response?), both present; constraint-omission is the named failure mode.
6. **Gaming-surface atoms.** The cleverest defection the proposed incentives still permit.
7. **Confidence and information-assumption atoms.** Confidence per claim plus what each party is assumed to know; posture-drift (analysis vs. design) is reshaped to an explicit marker.

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut:** unnamed asymmetries, selection/hazard conflation, single-constraint mechanisms, mechanism name-drops, posture blur, and full-information assumptions that dissolve the problem.

**What NOT to collapse:** the selection-vs-hazard distinction, the participation-and-incentive-compatibility pair (both constraints), and the analysis-vs-design posture marker.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: the information asymmetry is named (who knows/does what unseen); adverse selection is distinguished from moral hazard; for a design, both participation and incentive-compatibility constraints are addressed; any named mechanism corresponds to an operation shown on this situation; the analysis-vs-design posture is explicit; and confidence is stated with the information-assumptions named. Confidence is high only when depth and breadth converged on the classification of the asymmetry.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is an **information-and-incentive read** (and, when asked, a mechanism). Place the consolidated atoms into these sections, in order:

1. **Parties and the asymmetry.** `**Parties:** [...]. **Private information / hidden action:** [who knows or does what, unobserved by whom]. **When:** [before contracting → type; after → action].`
2. **Selection vs. hazard.** `**Adverse selection (hidden type):** [...]` and/or `**Moral hazard (hidden action):** [...]` — name both if both operate.
3. **The distortion.** Bulleted: which good actors exit, which risks are taken, who overpays, pooling vs. separating outcome.
4. **Named mechanisms in play.** Per concept: `**[winner's curse / signaling / screening / principal-agent]:** operation here [...]. Ruled in/out because [...].`
5. **Mechanism (for a design).** `**Proposal:** [...]. **Participation constraint:** [why parties join]. **Incentive-compatibility:** [why honest/effortful behavior is their best response]. **Residual gaming surface:** [...].` Omit this section for a pure analysis and say so.
6. **Read.** Bulleted: the conclusion (why it misfires / what the mechanism achieves), with the posture (analysis vs. design) marked.
7. **Confidence and assumptions.** Per-claim confidence plus the information-assumptions each party's behavior rests on.

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 7.
- Section 2 keeps adverse selection and moral hazard distinct; conflation is reshaped.
- Section 5 appears only for a design and must carry BOTH constraints; a single-constraint mechanism is reshaped.
- The analysis-vs-design posture (section 6) is marked explicitly; silent sliding is reshaped.
- A game tree, signaling diagram, or screening menu is diagram-friendly and welcome when it carries the argument.

## CAVEATS AND OPEN DEBATES

Mechanism and Incentive Analysis is a new T18 resident (2026-06-01), un-deferring the `mechanism-design` expansion candidate the territory had flagged (CR-6). It is the complexity-axis sibling of `strategic-interaction`: that mode analyzes games of observable moves; this one handles the case where hidden information (adverse selection), hidden action (moral hazard), and incentive structure are the crux, and extends to designing mechanisms that align incentives. The parse-preserving boundary against `market-dynamics` (T17) is information vs. price: this mode is about who-knows-what and how incentives are structured; market-dynamics is about how prices and quantities behave. The standing debate is how far the design end should go before it becomes a full formal mechanism-design exercise (revelation principle, optimal-auction derivation); v1 keeps designs at the structural level — constraints named and satisfied qualitatively — and flags when a problem genuinely needs formal optimization.
