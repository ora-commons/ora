## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Depth in Decision Architecture is the degree to which the four synthesis stages actually integrate component outputs rather than concatenating them. A thin molecular pass runs decision-under-uncertainty, constraint-mapping, stakeholder-mapping, and pre-mortem-action and stitches their outputs together; a substantive pass surfaces tensions among them — for instance, a constraint that invalidates the probability-weighted leading option, or a stakeholder impact that flips the pre-mortem failure scenario. Test depth by asking: does the integrated architecture contain a recommendation that no single component could have produced?

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Breadth in Decision Architecture is the catalog of alternatives considered before the architecture narrows to a recommendation. Widen the lens to scan: status-quo alternative; obvious binary; creative third option; do-nothing; reverse-the-question; defer-and-monitor. Even when the recommendation lands on one alternative, breadth is documented in the alternatives section. Breadth also covers stakeholder enumeration: ensure the stakeholder-mapping fragment surveys absent voices, not just visible parties.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Decision Architecture is the molecular T3 mode integrating decision-under-uncertainty (probability-weighted outcomes), constraint-mapping (binding constraints), stakeholder-mapping (per-alternative stakeholder impacts), and pre-mortem-action (failure-pathway stress test) through four sequenced synthesis stages into a single integrated recommendation. It is distinct from constraint-mapping (light deterministic terrain), decision-under-uncertainty (probability-weighted but stakeholder-light), multi-criteria-decision (criteria-weighting complexity), and decision-clarity (decision document for a third-party decision-maker, not your own decision). The mode's distinctive value is integration — a recommendation no single component could have produced; silo-aggregation is the load-bearing failure mode.

**Procedure.**

1. State the decision being architected once at the head — scope, time horizon, who decides.
2. Enumerate alternatives broadly — at least three, with at least one analyst-generated (status-quo, creative third, do-nothing, reverse-the-question, defer-and-monitor). Binary framings without analyst expansion are option-set-poverty.
3. For each alternative attach probability-weighted outcomes from decision-under-uncertainty — bands when uncertain, point estimates when well-anchored, provenance-tagged.
4. Attach binding constraints from constraint-mapping per alternative — each constraint names which alternatives it eliminates or qualifies, and the binding mechanism (hard / soft / contingent).
5. Attach per-alternative stakeholder impacts from stakeholder-mapping — direction, magnitude, power-asymmetry note when the stakeholder bears the impact but cannot influence the decision. A flat stakeholder list disconnected from alternatives is the failure mode.
6. Run pre-mortem stress test on the leading alternative(s) — failure-pathway narratives in past-tense prospective-hindsight, leading indicators, recoverability assessment.
7. Integrate the four components — surface tensions: a constraint that invalidates the probability-weighted leader, a stakeholder impact that flips the pre-mortem scenario, a failure pathway that defeats the constraint-favoured option. Stapling four sub-pass sections in sequence is silo-aggregation.
8. Produce a single recommendation with residual risks — what the recommendation does NOT eliminate. Clean recommendations without residual risks are hedging-disguised-as-rigor.
9. Specify decision-conditions-to-monitor concretely — each names an observable signal, threshold, and signal latency (how long after the underlying shift the signal appears). Vague conditions ("monitor the situation") are monitoring-vagueness.
10. Map confidence — synthesis-stage atoms inherit lower confidence than component-stage atoms; uniform confidence across both surfaces is miscalibrated.

**Goal.** Produce a structured integrated decision architecture — alternatives with attached attributes (probability-weighted outcomes, binding constraints, stakeholder impacts, failure pathways), a single recommendation with residual risks, and concrete monitoring conditions — that the four components could not individually have produced.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — option-set breadth.** Have alternatives been generated broadly enough, or is the analysis evaluating an artificially narrow option set? Failure mode if unmet: `option-set-poverty`.
- **CQ2 — integration vs concatenation (load-bearing).** Do the constraint findings actually bound the alternatives, or do they sit in a separate silo from the probability-weighted outcomes? Failure mode if unmet: `silo-aggregation`.
- **CQ3 — per-alternative stakeholder impact.** Are the stakeholder impacts surfaced per alternative, or aggregated into a generic stakeholder list disconnected from choice? Failure mode if unmet: `stakeholder-disconnection`.
- **CQ4 — pre-mortem on leading alternative (load-bearing).** Has the leading alternative been pre-mortem-stress-tested, or has the synthesis presented a recommendation without naming failure pathways? Failure mode if unmet: `pre-mortem-omission`.
- **CQ5 — monitoring concreteness.** Are the decision-conditions-to-monitor concrete enough to detect drift, or vague enough to be unfalsifiable? Failure mode if unmet: `monitoring-vagueness`.

A passing output maps ≥3 alternatives (including ≥1 analyst-generated), attaches probability-weighted outcomes / binding constraints / stakeholder impacts / failure pathways per alternative with provenance tags, produces a recommendation that integrates all four component findings with named residual risks, specifies concrete monitoring conditions with observable signals and signal latency, and calibrates confidence separately for component-stage and synthesis-stage atoms.

**Named failure modes.**

- *option-set-poverty* — alternatives enumerated are fewer than three or are obvious binary; no creative or boundary alternative considered.
- *silo-aggregation* — synthesis stages concatenate constraint, decision-under-uncertainty, stakeholder, and pre-mortem outputs without integration.
- *stakeholder-disconnection* — stakeholder impacts listed once for the situation generally rather than mapped per alternative.
- *pre-mortem-omission* — pre-mortem-action did not run against the leading alternative.
- *monitoring-vagueness* — decision-conditions-to-monitor stated as "watch how things develop" or similar without concrete signals.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to deepen synthesis where it concatenates. Revise to surface tensions where the draft has resolved them prematurely (e.g., stakeholder impacts that quietly contradict the recommendation should be named, not smoothed over). Revise to add concrete monitoring conditions where the draft is vague. Resist revising toward clean-recommendation framing that omits residual risks — Decision Architecture honors residual uncertainty.

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **alternative atoms with attached per-alternative attributes (probability-weighted outcomes, binding constraints, stakeholder impacts, failure pathways)**, integrated via the four synthesis stages rather than concatenated. Each atom carries component-provenance tags so the integration is auditable. The atoms are:

1. **Decision-statement atom.** The decision being architected, stated once at the corpus head. Cross-stream paraphrase collapses to one canonical statement.

2. **Alternative atoms.** Each carries: alternative statement, probability-weighted outcomes (provenance: decision-under-uncertainty), binding constraints (provenance: constraint-mapping), stakeholder impacts per stakeholder (provenance: stakeholder-mapping + decision-architecture synthesis), and failure pathways from pre-mortem stress test (provenance: pre-mortem-action). At least three alternatives must survive cross-stream dedup or option-set-poverty fires; at least one must be analyst-generated (creative-third / do-nothing / reverse-the-question / defer-and-monitor).

3. **Per-alternative stakeholder-impact atoms.** Stakeholder impacts attach to specific alternatives, not to the situation generally. Stakeholder-disconnection is the named failure mode; a corpus carrying a single "stakeholder list" rather than per-alternative impact maps is its signature. Each atom names: stakeholder, alternative under consideration, impact direction (positive / negative / neutral), magnitude, and power-asymmetry note where the stakeholder cannot influence the decision but bears the impact.

4. **Constraint-binding atoms.** Each binding constraint atom carries: constraint statement, which alternatives it eliminates or qualifies, and the mechanism of binding (hard / soft / contingent-on-other-decision). Silo-aggregation is the failure mode here: constraints listed once without binding-to-alternatives are concatenation, not integration.

5. **Failure-pathway atoms per leading alternative.** Pre-mortem stress test outputs attach to the leading alternative(s) — failure narratives, leading indicators, and recoverability assessment per pathway. Pre-mortem-omission is the named failure mode; a leading alternative without attached failure pathways does not survive corpus assembly.

6. **Recommendation atom with residual risks.** A single corpus-level recommendation atom carries: recommended alternative, integrated rationale (synthesizing all four component findings, not a single component's verdict), and residual risks that survive the synthesis (the risks the recommendation does NOT eliminate). Residual-risk atoms are load-bearing — a clean-recommendation atom without residual risks is the polished-recommendation failure pattern revision-guidance flags.

7. **Decision-conditions-to-monitor atoms.** Each names: observable signal, alternative or risk it monitors, threshold or pattern that would trigger reassessment, and signal latency (how long after the underlying condition shifts does the signal appear). Monitoring-vagueness is the named failure mode; conditions like "watch how things develop" do not survive — either an observable signal with threshold survives or the atom is dropped.

8. **Confidence map.** Confidence markers attach to individual atoms (probability weights, stakeholder-impact assessments, failure-pathway likelihoods). When the two streams assigned different confidences to the same atom, audit conservatism applies (the lower confidence survives).

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut during the bloat strip:**

- **Component-output concatenation residue** — when prose simply transcribes a component's output verbatim ("Constraint mapping identified X, Y, Z" / "Stakeholder mapping found A, B, C") without integrating it into the decision architecture. Silo-aggregation residue; the corpus carries integrated atoms, not concatenated component sections.
- **Stakeholder-list-without-per-alternative-impact** — a single flat stakeholder enumeration not mapped to alternatives. Stakeholder-disconnection residue; either the stakeholders attach to per-alternative-impact atoms or they do not survive.
- **Alternative-paraphrase loops** — same alternative under different framings. Single canonical statement survives.
- **Constraint-restatement** — same binding constraint named multiple times. Single atom survives with the most precise binding mechanism.
- **Vague-monitoring-conditions** — "monitor the situation", "watch for developments", "track relevant signals". Monitoring-vagueness residue; either replaced with concrete observable + threshold or dropped.
- **Recommendation-hedging-without-residual-risk** — soft recommendation language ("on balance perhaps", "it might be worth considering") that elides residual risks rather than naming them. The recommendation atom is allowed to be qualified, but qualification without residual-risk-atoms is hedging-as-substitute-for-rigor.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **Cross-stream leading-alternative disagreement** — when one stream's integration produced alternative A as the leading recommendation and the other produced alternative B, preserve as a recommendation-tension atom. The disagreement is itself a finding about which integration weights (uncertainty / constraints / stakeholders / failure modes) carry more in this decision; the consolidator must not silently pick.
- **Stakeholder-impact disagreement per alternative** — when streams disagreed on whether a stakeholder is helped or hurt by alternative X, preserve both impact-directions as parallel atoms. The disagreement may reveal that the stakeholder's interest is itself contested or that the alternative's stakeholder-effect depends on implementation choices not yet specified.
- **Constraint-binding disagreement** — when one stream judged constraint C binding on alternative A and the other did not, preserve both judgments. Whether a constraint binds is consequential; silent reconciliation is silo-aggregation residue.
- **Failure-pathway-completeness disagreement** — when streams identified different failure pathways for the same leading alternative, preserve all surviving pathways. Pre-mortem-action's value is breadth of failure-narrative generation; merging non-overlapping pathways is bloat-cutting, but losing distinct pathways is content loss.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: every component ran (or was flagged as proceeded-with-gap); the four synthesis stages integrated rather than concatenated; the leading alternative carries a pre-mortem stress test; decision-conditions-to-monitor are concrete; confidence map is populated. The five critical questions are addressed in the output.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is a **structured integrated decision architecture: alternatives with attached attributes (probability-weighted outcomes, binding constraints, stakeholder impacts, failure pathways), single recommendation with residual risks, and concrete monitoring conditions**. Place the consolidated-corpus atoms into the following sections, in this order:

1. **Decision frame.** One paragraph stating the decision, its scope, and its time horizon. Frame as "Decision being architected:"

2. **Alternatives with probability-weighted outcomes.** For each alternative A1, A2, A3, …, render a block:
   - **Alternative:** one-line statement
   - **Probability-weighted outcomes:** named outcomes with probability bands (when uncertain) or point estimates (when well-anchored); provenance tag `[from decision-under-uncertainty]`
   - **Origin:** user-supplied / analyst-generated / hybrid

   At minimum three alternatives; at least one analyst-generated.

3. **Binding constraints per alternative.** For each constraint, render: `**[Constraint]** — applies to alternatives: [A_n list]. Mechanism of binding: [hard / soft / contingent-on-other-decision]. Eliminates: [which alternatives the constraint rules out].` Provenance tag `[from constraint-mapping]`. The constraints must attach to alternatives explicitly — silo-aggregation is the named failure mode.

4. **Stakeholder impact per alternative.** A table or per-stakeholder block. For each (stakeholder, alternative) pair, render: stakeholder, alternative, impact direction (positive / negative / neutral), magnitude (high / moderate / low), power-asymmetry note (when the stakeholder cannot influence the decision but bears the impact). Provenance tag `[from stakeholder-mapping]`. The per-alternative attachment is load-bearing — stakeholder-disconnection is the named failure mode.

5. **Failure pathways for the leading alternative(s).** For the leading alternative (and any close runners-up), bulleted list of failure pathways. Each bullet: `**[Failure narrative in past-tense prospective-hindsight]** — causal pathway: [current state → failure]. Leading indicators: [what would reveal the pathway taking]. Recoverability: [recoverable / unrecoverable] — reason: [...].` Provenance tag `[from pre-mortem-action]`. At minimum one failure pathway per leading alternative.

6. **Recommended alternative with residual risks.** A single block: `**Recommended: A_n** — integrated rationale: [synthesis across all four components, not single-component verdict]. Residual risks that survive the recommendation: [list]. What this recommendation does NOT eliminate: [the risks that persist regardless of choice].` The residual-risk content is load-bearing; a clean recommendation without residual risks is hedging-disguised-as-rigor.

7. **Decision conditions to monitor.** Numbered list. Each item: `**[Condition name]** — observable signal: [specific signal with threshold]. Monitors: [which alternative or risk]. Trigger: [pattern that would prompt reassessment]. Signal latency: [how long after underlying shift before signal appears].` Vague conditions ("monitor the situation") do not appear — monitoring-vagueness is the named failure mode.

8. **Confidence map.** Bulleted list of confidence markers attached to probability weights, stakeholder-impact assessments, failure-pathway likelihoods, and the overall recommendation. Per-finding confidence with reason.

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 8.
- Provenance tags (`[from decision-under-uncertainty]`, `[from constraint-mapping]`, `[from stakeholder-mapping]`, `[from pre-mortem-action]`) appear inline where atoms originate from specific components — they make integration auditable and silo-aggregation visible.
- Alternative IDs (A1, A2, …) are referenced consistently throughout once introduced.
- Section 4's stakeholder-impact rendering: table form when ≤4 stakeholders × ≤4 alternatives; per-stakeholder blocks when complexity exceeds table-readability.
- The single recommendation in section 6 is integrated, not a single component's verdict. If the recommendation matches one component's leading choice exactly, name what the other three components contributed to the rationale.
