## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Depth in Compositional Dynamics is the precision with which (1) the perceptual parse is predicted (groupings via proximity / similarity / common fate / good continuation / closure / symmetry / parallelism / common region / connectedness; figure-ground assignment with border-ownership), (2) the structural skeleton is identified (axes, center, frame), (3) visual weights are assigned to elements on empirical grounds (size, contrast, color, isolation, position, depth), (4) force vectors and named tensions are named, and (5) ambiguity-loci (where the parse is unstable; figure-ground reversal candidates) are surfaced. A thin pass produces a generic "this composition is balanced" verdict; a substantive pass predicts the viewer's perceptual parse with the cues responsible for each grouping, identifies the skeleton with cropping-robustness, assigns weights with empirical defensibility, names the dynamic equilibrium type (stable / unstable / directional), and surfaces ambiguity-loci. Test depth by asking: would small displacements of elements alter the reading substantively (i.e., is the reading doing analytical work or post-hoc storytelling)?

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Widening the lens means scanning across the two integrated traditions before narrowing: **Gestalt grouping and figure-ground** (Wertheimer / Köhler / Koffka founding work; Wagemans et al. 2012 century-of-gestalt review; Rubin 1921 figure-ground; border-ownership neurons per Zhou, Friedman & von der Heydt 2000) — predicts how perception parses the visual field; **Arnheim compositional forces** (*Art and Visual Perception*, *The Power of the Center*, *The Dynamics of Architectural Form*; McManus, Stöver & Kim 2011 partial empirical support for center-of-mass formalization) — predicts the force vectors, tensions, and dynamic equilibrium once the parse is established. Where applicable, scan also: **Itten** (seven color contrasts); **Albers** (color's absolute relativity, figure-ground reversal via color); **Hambidge** (proportional vocabulary, treated as tool with weak empirical warrant); **cinematic mise-en-scène** for film stills. Breadth markers: the reading has surveyed both gestalt parsing AND Arnheim forces (the M2+M3 integration) and has applied color/proportion lenses where relevant before producing findings.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Compositional Dynamics is a universal-perceptual reading of a spatial composition that integrates Gestalt grouping principles (proximity, similarity, common fate, good continuation, closure, symmetry, parallelism, common region, connectedness; figure-ground with border-ownership) with Arnheim compositional forces (structural skeleton, visual weight on empirical grounds, force vectors, dynamic equilibrium), supplemented where applicable by Itten contrasts and Albers color-field interactions. It is distinct from ma-reading (Japanese aesthetics of held-open void), place-reading-genius-loci (affordance + inhabited place), and information-density (Tufte/Bertin/Cleveland-McGill applied evaluation). It is descriptive of perceptual dynamics — predicting the viewer's parse and force-reading — not symbolic interpretation of meaning.

**Procedure.**

1. Name the composition and focal question (if any) at the head.
2. Predict the perceptual parse — groupings with the specific Gestalt cue(s) responsible (proximity / similarity / etc.); test each grouping with cue-swap robustness.
3. Assign figure-ground with border-ownership reading — note whether the assignment is stable, contested, or reverses under attention shift.
4. Identify the structural skeleton — axes, center, frame — and test with cropping-robustness (does the skeleton survive cropping, or is it the analyst's framing?).
5. Assign visual weight per element on empirical grounds — size, contrast, color, isolation, position, depth — never on symbolic meaning.
6. Name force vectors and tensions — each with direction, source, target; test with displacement-robustness (would small displacement alter the reading, or is the force-story decorative?).
7. Classify dynamic equilibrium — stable / unstable / directional, with reason.
8. Predict an eye-path — likely fixation sequence with cues driving each fixation.
9. Surface ambiguity loci — places where the parse is unstable, figure-ground reversal candidates, alternative readings.
10. Escalate sideways to ma-reading when held-open void is doing the operative compositional work rather than figure-ground / grouping / force vectors.

**Goal.** Produce a reading-with-vocabulary using Gestalt and Arnheim concepts operatively (not decoratively), predicting the perceptual parse, naming force vectors that survive displacement, classifying dynamic equilibrium, and surfacing ambiguity loci.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — cue-swap robustness for groupings.** Does the proposed grouping survive a swap of grouping cues, or is it brittle to cue substitution? Failure mode if unmet: `cue-fragile-grouping`.
- **CQ2 — border-ownership for figure-ground.** Does the figure-ground assignment reverse under attention shift, or is it locked? Where contested, are the borders unambiguously owned or contested? Failure mode if unmet: `contested-border-asserted-as-stable`.
- **CQ3 — displacement-robustness for forces.** Does displacing an element by a small amount alter the reading substantively, or is the force-story decorative? Failure mode if unmet: `post-hoc-force-story`.
- **CQ4 — cropping-robustness for skeleton.** Does the structural-skeleton assignment survive cropping, or is the skeleton imposed by the analyst's frame? Failure mode if unmet: `imposed-skeleton`.
- **CQ5 — empirical visual-weight grounds.** Are visual-weight assignments empirically defensible (size, contrast, color, isolation, position), or is the analyst asserting symbolic weight masquerading as visual weight? Failure mode if unmet: `symbolic-weight-confusion`.

A passing output predicts the perceptual parse with cue-robustness, identifies the skeleton with cropping-robustness, assigns visual weights on empirical grounds, names force vectors with displacement-robustness, classifies dynamic equilibrium, predicts an eye-path, and surfaces ambiguity loci with alternative parses.

**Named failure modes.**

- *cue-fragile-grouping* — reading proposes a grouping that depends on a single cue and would dissolve if the cue were swapped.
- *contested-border-asserted-as-stable* — reading asserts a stable figure-ground for a composition where border-ownership is contested or the figure-ground reverses under attention shift.
- *post-hoc-force-story* — reading describes force vectors and tensions that would survive arbitrary displacement of elements; the force-story is decorative rather than analytical.
- *imposed-skeleton* — reading asserts a structural skeleton that does not survive cropping; the skeleton is the analyst's frame, not the composition's.
- *symbolic-weight-confusion* — reading attributes high visual weight on grounds of meaning or symbol rather than empirical visual properties.
- *void-blindness* — reading produces forces-and-grouping analysis where the operative work is being done by held-open void; ma-reading would have been the right mode.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to perform the cue-swap test where the draft proposes brittle groupings. Revise to acknowledge contested borders where the draft asserts stable figure-ground. Revise to perform the displacement test where force vectors are decorative. Revise to perform the cropping test where the skeleton may be the analyst's imposition. Revise to substitute empirical visual-weight grounds where the draft attributes weight on symbolic-meaning grounds. Revise sideways to ma-reading where the operative work is being done by held-open void. Resist revising toward purely formal description without predicted consequence — the mode is descriptive of perceptual *dynamics*; a static catalogue of elements without parse-predictions and force-predictions is a thin pass, not the medium-depth reading the mode targets.

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **a perceptual-parse + force-pattern reading: groupings with cues, figure-ground with border-ownership, structural skeleton, visual-weight atoms (empirically grounded), force vectors with displacement-robustness, dynamic-equilibrium classification, eye-path prediction, and ambiguity-loci atoms**. The atoms are:

1. **Composition-and-focus atom.** What composition is being read, and the focal question (if any). One short paragraph.

2. **Perceptual-parse atoms.** Each grouping carries: which elements are grouped, the cue(s) responsible (proximity / similarity / common fate / good continuation / closure / symmetry / parallelism / common region / connectedness), and cue-swap robustness (would it survive a cue substitution?). Cue-fragile-grouping is the named failure mode.

3. **Figure-ground atoms.** Each ground-figure assignment carries border-ownership reading and reversal-under-attention-shift tag (stable / contested / reverses). Contested-border-asserted-as-stable is the named failure mode.

4. **Structural-skeleton atom.** Axes, center, frame, with cropping-robustness assessment. Imposed-skeleton is the named failure mode.

5. **Visual-weight atoms per element.** Each weight assignment carries empirical grounds (size / contrast / color / isolation / position / depth — not symbolic meaning). Symbolic-weight-confusion is the named failure mode.

6. **Force-vector atoms with named tensions.** Each force vector carries direction, source, target, and displacement-robustness assessment. Post-hoc-force-story is the named failure mode; force-readings that would survive arbitrary displacement of elements do not survive into the corpus.

7. **Dynamic-equilibrium classification atom.** Stable / unstable / directional, with reason.

8. **Predicted eye-path atom.** Likely fixation sequence with cues driving each fixation.

9. **Ambiguity-loci atoms.** Each names a place where the parse is unstable (figure-ground reversal candidates, weight-distribution alternatives, contested groupings) with the alternative reading.

10. **Void-blindness escalation atom — when applicable.** When held-open void is doing the operative compositional work, the corpus suppresses the forces/grouping reading and renders the escalation to ma-reading.

11. **Confidence per finding.**

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut:**

- **Cue-fragile groupings without flagging** — groupings stated as findings when cue-substitution would dissolve them.
- **Symbolic-weight smuggled as visual-weight** — attributions on grounds of meaning rather than empirical perceptual properties.
- **Decorative force-stories** — force vectors that would describe any arbitrary arrangement equally well.
- **Imposed-skeleton residue** — structural skeletons keyed to the analyst's framing rather than to the composition.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **Figure-ground reversal candidates** — when streams disagreed on the stable assignment for a composition with ambiguous border-ownership, preserve both readings.
- **Grouping disagreements** — when streams parsed elements differently, preserve both with their respective cue-attributions.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: groupings survive the cue-swap test (or are flagged as cue-fragile); figure-ground assignment is accompanied by border-ownership assessment; force vectors survive the displacement test; structural skeleton survives the cropping test; visual-weight assignments are on empirical grounds; ambiguity-loci are surfaced. The five critical questions are addressable from the output. Confidence per finding accompanies each major claim. Cross-reference to T19 territory-level open debates (especially Debate 3 on aesthetic-vs.-analytical scope and Debate 5 on AI implementability of perceptual operations) is noted where the reading depends on the descriptive-analytical commitment.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is a **reading-with-vocabulary** — a structured perceptual reading using Gestalt and Arnheim vocabulary where the vocabulary is operative (not decorative). Place the consolidated-corpus atoms into the following sections, in this order:

1. **Perceptual parse — groupings and figure-ground.** Two sub-blocks:
   - **Groupings:** bulleted list. Each: `**[Grouping]** — cues: [proximity / similarity / common fate / good continuation / closure / symmetry / parallelism / common region / connectedness]. Cue-swap robustness: [robust / fragile].`
   - **Figure-ground:** bulleted list. Each: `[Figure] vs [ground] — border-ownership: [assigned to figure / assigned to ground / contested]. Reversal under attention shift: [stable / reverses].`

2. **Structural skeleton — axes and center.** One paragraph naming the principal axes, center of mass, and frame. Each named structural element carries a cropping-robustness note.

3. **Visual weight per element.** A table or per-element list. Each element: `[Element] — weight: [high / moderate / low]. Empirical grounds: [size / contrast / color / isolation / position / depth — name the specific properties].`

4. **Force vectors and named tensions.** Bulleted list. Each force vector: `**[Force vector name]** — from [source] toward [target]. Displacement-robustness: [robust / decorative].` Each named tension: `**[Tension]** — between [element A] and [element B]. Stress point: [...].`

5. **Dynamic equilibrium classification.** One sentence: `Equilibrium type: [stable / unstable / directional]. Reason: [...].`

6. **Predicted eye-path.** A numbered sequence: `1 → 2 → 3 → ...` with each fixation tagged: `Fixation N: [element]. Cue drawing the eye: [...].`

7. **Ambiguity loci and alternative parses.** Bulleted list. Each: `**[Locus]** — primary reading: [...]. Alternative reading: [...]. What makes the parse unstable: [reason].`

8. **Confidence per finding.** Bulleted list of confidence markers per major claim.

9. **Annotated visual overlay (when image attached).** When the user attached a photograph or raster image, optionally emit one `annotated_image` envelope to overlay annotations on the user's uploaded image at normalized image-relative coordinates. `canvas_action: annotate`; one envelope per response. Each annotation entry carries `kind` (callout / box / arrow / highlight / text), normalized `x: 0–1`, `y: 0–1` (top-left origin), and optional `width: 0–1`, `height: 0–1`, `to_x: 0–1`, `to_y: 0–1`. Use this overlay to mark force vectors, named tensions, ambiguity loci, and figure-ground boundary segments where the parse is contested. Schema and full envelope skeleton in `modes/spatial-reasoning.md §7 Path B`.

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 8.
- Vocabulary stays operative — name the Gestalt cue, the Arnheim force concept, the Itten contrast — rather than using the term decoratively without invoking its operational meaning.
- **Perceptual evidence only — no imported framings.** Every named force, tension, and equilibrium claim must cite perceptual evidence in the image (position, size, contrast, cue). Do not import thematic, cosmological, narrative, or metaphorical "framings" — even as a labelled "wrapper" — unless the visual content itself supplies them. Retrieved context that is not about this image is not evidence. This extends the anti-symbolic-weight discipline (CQ5 / `symbolic-weight-confusion`): a thematic overlay smuggled in as a "framing" or "wrapper" is the same defect as symbolic weight masquerading as visual weight, and is reshaped at this layer.
- Cue-swap, border-ownership, displacement-robustness, and cropping-robustness assessments appear inline with the claims they qualify, not in a separate methodological footnote.
- When the operative compositional work is being done by held-open void (void-blindness detected), the deliverable renders an explicit sideways-escalation block: `**Note: held-open void is doing the operative compositional work; ma-reading is the appropriate mode. Switching to ma-reading is recommended.**` Subsequent sections may be omitted if the escalation is the primary finding.

## CAVEATS AND OPEN DEBATES

This mode does not carry mode-specific debates. Five territory-level debates (per Decision G) are documented in `Reference — Analytical Territories.md` T19 entry and bear on Compositional Dynamics specifically:

1. **Spatial vs. compositional framing.** "Spatial Composition" preserves the spatial focus while allowing the underlying operation to generalize. Compositional Dynamics retains the spatial focus (gestalt operations are perceptually-spatial; Arnheim forces are spatial-compositional) but the territory's name carries the open question.
2. **Aesthetic-only or also abstract spatial inputs?** Compositional Dynamics sits squarely on the universal-perceptual side: the mode applies to dashboards, network diagrams (qua images), pages of typography, and ordinary visual layouts — not just to paintings. The unified territory rests on the claim that the perceptual-grouping and force operations are the same across aesthetic and applied inputs.
3. **Western-analytical and Eastern-aesthetic: same operation or convergent traditions?** Compositional Dynamics is the analytical-Western pole; ma-reading is the experiential-Eastern pole. The strong reading holds these are the same operation in different vocabularies; the weaker reading holds the epistemic warrants differ. The mode is implemented on the analytical side, with sideways-escalation to ma-reading flagged when the operative compositional work is being done by held-open void rather than by figure-ground/grouping/forces.
4. **Verbal accessibility for AI implementation.** Pessimistic view: gestalt grouping is perceptual, not propositional, and verbal descriptions cannot reproduce the phenomenology of border-ownership flips. Optimistic view: the AI's job is to predict consequences of structure, not have the experience. Middle view: implementable for direct image input or high-fidelity verbal description; degrades for rough sketch.
5. **Mode granularity: general vs. tradition-specific.** Whether information-graphic-specific operations (Tufte data-ink, Bertin visual variables, Cleveland-McGill elementary tasks) should be promoted to a dedicated Mode 5 (held in reserve per T19 territory documentation) or remain a specificity-variant inside Compositional Dynamics. Below the 15% info-graphic-invocation threshold (per Decision G), info-graphic inputs are routed through this mode with Tufte/Bertin/Cleveland citations; above the threshold, promote.

These five debates are *not* re-documented here. They are referenced because they bear on Compositional Dynamics's stance, lens dependencies, and mode-granularity boundary with the reserved Information-Graphic mode. See the T19 entry in `Reference — Analytical Territories.md` for the full debate text and citations.

**Integration note (M2 + M3 combined per locked decisions).** This mode combines M2 (Figure-Ground & Perceptual-Grouping Analysis / Gestalt-mode) and M3 (Compositional-Forces & Balance Analysis / Arnheim-mode) from the T19 reanalysis §3 mode catalog. The integration follows the locked decisions: M2 (perceptual parse) runs first conceptually, then M3 (forces among parsed elements) layers on top — the two operations are sequenced within a single mode because (a) they almost always co-occur on the same input, (b) M3 takes M2's output as input (forces operate on parsed groupings), and (c) splitting them would generate two modes whose outputs always cite each other. Itten's seven contrasts and Albers's *Interaction of Color* ride inside as optional lenses for color-driven figure-ground and force phenomena. The reserved Mode 5 (Information-Graphic Visual-Hierarchy Analysis, Tufte/Bertin/Cleveland) is held against the territory-level promotion threshold; below threshold, info-graphic inputs route through this mode.
