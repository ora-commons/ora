## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Depth in Process Mapping is the explicitness of (a) actor-and-role attribution per step (who does what), (b) decision-point criteria (what triggers each branch), (c) dependency relationships between steps (what blocks what), and (d) bottleneck constraint-identification (not just where it slows but why it slows). A thin pass lists the steps; a substantive pass attributes each step to an actor, identifies decision-point criteria explicitly, maps step-to-step dependencies, and names the underlying constraint at each bottleneck (capacity / authority / information / sequencing). Test depth by asking: could a new actor entering the process at any step understand from the map alone what they need, who they wait for, and what unblocks them?

**Substrate check before mapping.** If the prompt supplies no concrete process content — no named steps, no real actors, no observed timings or pain points — do NOT fabricate a representative archetype as the deliverable. Lead with the named gap and a single elicitation block ("To map your actual process I need: the start trigger, the end condition, the actors, and 3–5 known steps or pain points"). An archetype may follow only as an explicitly-labelled illustrative scaffold subordinate to that request — never as the primary output. A clearly-flagged archetype with placeholder metrics still reads as generic; the elicitation is what converts this into the user's actual map.

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Widening the lens means scanning for exception paths and edge cases (what happens when the input is malformed, when an actor is absent, when a dependency is unavailable), surfacing the gap between documented and actual process flow, and identifying handoff friction (information loss, role-confusion, queue accumulation) at every actor boundary. Breadth markers: the map shows at least one exception path explicitly, surfaces at least one official-vs-actual deviation, and flags handoffs as friction zones rather than treating them as transparent.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Process Mapping is a current-state documentation method that produces a directed step-graph with actor swim-lanes, decision-point branches, dependency arcs, bottleneck atoms (constraint-typed), and handoff-friction findings. It is descriptive of how the process actually flows — distinct from systems-dynamics-structural (complexity-counterpart; cyclic feedback structure rather than linear / branching process flow), mechanism-understanding (T16; how the parts produce the whole's behavior at the principle level, not the step-by-step flow), root-cause-analysis (T4; why a particular outcome occurred), and future-state design (execution-tier T21 or future-mode T6). The mode is acyclic by territory — feedback loops escalate to systems-dynamics-structural — and stays descriptive: causal explanation of why outcomes occur escalates to T4.

**Procedure.**

1. Lock process scope — name the process, the start trigger, the end condition; these govern what survives into the step graph.
2. Inventory actors and roles — each actor's responsibility scope and the steps they perform; orphan actors get flagged.
3. Decompose the process into steps — each with actor attribution (who performs it), predecessors, successors, and lane assignment. Steps without actor attribution do not survive as steps.
4. Surface decision points and branches — each with explicit decision criteria (never "depending on the situation") and the branches it spawns with the predicate routing to each.
5. Identify exception paths — what happens when input is malformed, when an actor is absent, when a dependency is unavailable; the breadth marker is at least one exception-path atom.
6. Map dependency arcs — "step A blocks step B" with the resource or precondition that creates the dependency; cycles are forbidden (escalate to systems-dynamics-structural if cycles exist).
7. Identify bottlenecks with underlying constraints typed — capacity / authority / information / sequencing — not just the symptom ("approval takes too long" + "single approver, no delegation authority, full inbox").
8. Examine handoffs between actors for friction type — information-loss / role-confusion / queue-accumulation / context-collapse — and the cost the friction imposes.
9. Surface official-vs-actual divergence — where the documented process differs from the lived process, with the deviation and any workaround. If not investigated, say so explicitly rather than defaulting to the official version.
10. Hold the territory line — stay descriptive; causal explanation of outcomes escalates to T4.

**Goal.** Produce a diagram-friendly process map — swim-lane step graph with decision-point branches, dependency arcs, bottleneck atoms (constraint-typed), and handoff-friction findings — that any new actor entering at any step could read to understand what they need, who they wait for, and what unblocks them.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — scope lock.** Have the process boundaries been locked (clear start trigger and end condition), or is the scope ambiguous? Failure mode if unmet: `scope-creep`.
- **CQ2 — official vs actual.** Has the analysis distinguished between the documented (official) process and the actual (lived) process, or described only one as if it were both? Failure mode if unmet: `official-vs-actual-elision`.
- **CQ3 — decision points and branches.** Have decision points and branching paths been identified with explicit decision criteria, or has the process been flattened into a single happy path? Failure mode if unmet: `happy-path-flattening`.
- **CQ4 — bottleneck constraint identification.** Have bottlenecks been identified with the underlying constraint typed (capacity / authority / information / sequencing), rather than just the symptom? Failure mode if unmet: `bottleneck-symptom-only`.
- **CQ5 — handoff examination.** Have handoffs between actors been examined for friction and information loss, or treated as frictionless? Failure mode if unmet: `handoff-blindness`.

A passing output locks scope explicitly, attributes each step to an actor, surfaces decision points with criteria, includes at least one exception-path atom, names bottlenecks with constraint-type tagged (using the canonical four labels), examines at least one handoff for friction (when multiple actors participate), acknowledges the official-vs-actual distinction (or marks it not-investigated), and stays descriptive — never overreaching into causal explanation.

**Named failure modes.**

- *scope-creep* — process boundaries shifted during execution; map covers more than the locked scope.
- *official-vs-actual-elision* — map describes the process as documented in policy without acknowledging known deviations or workarounds.
- *happy-path-flattening* — all branching paths collapsed to one main flow; exception paths absent.
- *bottleneck-symptom-only* — bottleneck named (e.g., "approval takes too long") without the underlying constraint identified (e.g., "single approver, no delegation").
- *handoff-blindness* — handoffs between actors presented without examining where information is lost, transformed, or queued.
- *causal-overreach* — process map presented as causal explanation of why outcomes occur; mode boundary violation into T4.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to add exception paths where the draft shows only the happy path. Revise to surface official-vs-actual deviations where the draft conflates them. Revise to identify the constraint underlying each bottleneck where the draft names only the symptom. Revise to examine handoffs as friction zones where the draft treats them as transparent. Resist revising toward causal explanation of outcomes — the mode's analytical character is descriptive process documentation. If the user wants causal analysis of why the process produces particular outcomes, escalate to T4 causal modes rather than overreaching the mapping.

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **a directed step-graph with actor swim-lanes, decision-point branches, bottleneck atoms (named with underlying constraints), and handoff-friction atoms**. The step graph is the load-bearing structure; actor attribution per step, constraint-typed bottlenecks, and explicit handoff-friction are the discipline. The atoms are:

1. **Scope-and-boundaries atom.** Process name, start-trigger, and end-condition stated once at the corpus head. Scope-creep is the named failure mode; the locked boundaries appear once and govern what survives into the step graph.

2. **Actor/role inventory atoms.** Each actor or role carries: name, scope of responsibility, and steps they perform. Actor atoms are cross-referenced by step atoms; orphan actors (named but doing no step in the map) are flagged as scope-creep residue or pending-clarification atoms.

3. **Step atoms.** Each step carries: step content, actor attribution (which role performs it), predecessor steps (what must complete first), successor steps, and lane assignment (when swim-lane format applies). Steps without actor attribution are component-inventory-without-function-equivalent residue — they do not survive as steps without a who.

4. **Decision-point atoms.** Each decision point carries: triggering condition, explicit decision criteria (not "depending on the situation"), and the branches it spawns with the predicate that routes to each. Happy-path-flattening is the named failure mode; a process with no decision-point atoms when branches actually exist is its corpus signature. At least one decision-point atom must survive when the process has any branching at all.

5. **Exception-path atoms.** Each names an exception case (malformed input, absent actor, unavailable dependency) and the alternative path taken. The breadth marker is at least one exception-path atom surviving; happy-path-only is happy-path-flattening residue.

6. **Dependency-map atoms.** Each is a "step A blocks step B" assertion, with the resource or precondition that creates the dependency. The dependency map is suitable for DAG rendering downstream; cycles are forbidden (process-mapping is acyclic by territory — feedback loops escalate to systems-dynamics-structural).

7. **Bottleneck atoms.** Each bottleneck carries: location (which step or handoff), symptom (what the user observes — "approval takes too long"), and **underlying constraint typed** as capacity / authority / information / sequencing (the actual mechanism creating the slow-down — "single approver with no delegation authority and full inbox"). Bottleneck-symptom-only is the named failure mode; an atom with symptom but no constraint-type does not survive as a bottleneck — it's either a pending-investigation atom or it's not a bottleneck.

8. **Handoff-friction atoms.** Each handoff between actors carries: source actor, target actor, what is transferred, friction type (information-loss / role-confusion / queue-accumulation / context-collapse), and the cost the friction imposes. Handoff-blindness is the named failure mode; handoffs treated as transparent are its corpus signature. At least one handoff-friction atom must survive when more than one actor participates in the process.

9. **Official-vs-actual divergence atoms.** Each names a step or handoff where the documented (official) process differs from the lived (actual) process, with the deviation and any workaround. Official-vs-actual-elision is the failure mode; a corpus that describes only one as if it were both is its signature. When neither divergence nor explicit alignment-confirmation is present, the corpus carries an explicit "official-vs-actual: not investigated in this pass" atom rather than silently defaulting to the official version.

10. **Confidence per finding.** Confidence markers attach to individual atoms. When the two streams assigned different confidences, audit conservatism applies.

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut during the bloat strip:**

- **Step-listing without actor** — steps named without who-performs-them. The corpus does not carry steps without actor atoms; either the actor is identified or the step is downgraded to a pending-clarification atom.
- **Bottleneck-symptom phrasing without constraint-type** — "this takes too long", "this is where things slow down" without the typed underlying constraint. Bottleneck-symptom-only residue; the atom is incomplete.
- **Happy-path-only narration** — sequential prose covering only the main flow without decision-point branches. Happy-path-flattening residue; either decision-point atoms with explicit criteria are added, or the corpus carries an explicit "happy-path-only: no branches identified" atom.
- **Frictionless-handoff phrasing** — "the work passes to X" without examining what is transferred and what is lost. Handoff-blindness residue; the atom either earns a friction-type or is downgraded.
- **Causal-explanation residue** — "this happens because of X", "the root cause of slow-down is Y". Causal-overreach residue; the mode is descriptive process documentation, not causal analysis. Causal-language phrases either get reframed as descriptive (what occurs, not why) or escalated to T4.
- **Documented-only restatement** — both streams restating the same official policy description without surfacing actual practice. Official-vs-actual-elision residue; the second restatement is bloat unless it adds an actual-process divergence atom.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **Official-vs-actual divergence** — when one stream described the official process and the other described an actual practice that diverges, preserve both as parallel atoms with the divergence explicitly named. The divergence is itself the finding; silent reconciliation toward the official version is the failure mode.
- **Bottleneck-constraint-type disagreement** — when streams diagnosed the same bottleneck with different underlying constraints (one says capacity, the other says authority), preserve both diagnoses as parallel atoms. The disagreement is consequential for what intervention would help; the consolidator must not silently pick.
- **Exception-path coverage** — when streams identified different exception cases, preserve all surviving exception-path atoms. The breadth value lies in the catalog of edge cases.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: process boundaries are locked with explicit start trigger and end condition; actors are inventoried with role attribution per step; decision points are surfaced with criteria; dependencies are mapped; bottlenecks are identified with underlying constraints (not just symptoms); handoffs are examined for friction; official-vs-actual distinction is acknowledged. The five critical questions are addressable from the output. Confidence per finding accompanies every claim.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is a **diagram-friendly process map: swim-lane step graph with decision-point branches, dependency arcs, bottleneck atoms (constraint-typed), and handoff-friction findings**. Place the consolidated-corpus atoms into the following sections, in this order:

1. **Process scope and boundaries.** Three labelled lines at the top:
   - **Process:** [name]
   - **Start trigger:** [the event or condition that initiates the process]
   - **End condition:** [how the process is known to be complete]

2. **Actor / role inventory.** Numbered list of actors. Each actor: `A_n: [name]. Role: [responsibility scope]. Steps: [list of step IDs this actor performs].`

3. **Sequential step breakdown (swim-lane).** Numbered list of steps (1.1, 1.2, ...). Each step: `**[Step N: short name]** — actor: A_n. Action: [what happens]. Predecessors: [list of prior step IDs]. Successors: [list of next step IDs].` Render as a swim-lane structure when the medium supports it: each actor as a horizontal lane with their steps arranged left-to-right.

4. **Decision points and branches.** Numbered list. Each decision point: `**[DP_n: short name]** — triggered after step [N]. Decision criteria: [explicit criteria, not "depending on the situation"]. Branches: [(condition A → step path A), (condition B → step path B), …].` At least one decision-point atom when branches exist; happy-path-flattening is the named failure mode.

5. **Exception paths.** Bulleted list of exception cases. Each bullet: `**[Exception]** — trigger: [what causes the exception]. Path taken: [alternative flow]. Recovery: [how the process resumes or terminates].` At minimum one exception-path atom — breadth marker.

6. **Dependency map.** Numbered list of dependency arcs. Each arc: `Step [N] blocks step [M] — dependency: [resource / precondition / authorization / information] that creates the block.` Cycles are forbidden (process-mapping is acyclic; feedback escalates to systems-dynamics-structural).

7. **Bottleneck identification.** Numbered list. Each bottleneck: `**[Bottleneck at step/handoff N]** — symptom: [what the user observes]. **Underlying constraint:** [capacity / authority / information / sequencing]. Mechanism: [the specific mechanism creating the slow-down].` Bottleneck-symptom-only is the named failure mode; the constraint-type tag is operative.

8. **Handoff and friction points.** Numbered list. Each handoff: `**[Handoff: source actor → target actor at step N]** — what transfers: [content]. Friction type: [information-loss / role-confusion / queue-accumulation / context-collapse]. Cost: [what the friction imposes].` At minimum one handoff-friction atom when more than one actor participates.

9. **Official vs actual divergence.** Bulleted list of steps or handoffs where the documented process differs from the lived process. Each bullet: `Step/handoff [N]: official says [X]; actual is [Y]. Deviation: [reason]. Workaround: [if known].` When no divergences are identified, render: "Official-vs-actual: not investigated in this pass" rather than implying alignment.

10. **Confidence per finding.** Bulleted list of confidence markers per finding (bottleneck constraint-types, handoff frictions, dependency arcs).

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 10.
- Step IDs follow consistent numbering (1.1, 1.2, ...) — visible in section 3 and referenced throughout.
- Bottleneck constraint-types use canonical four labels (capacity / authority / information / sequencing); do not invent intermediate categories.
- Handoff friction types use canonical four labels (information-loss / role-confusion / queue-accumulation / context-collapse).
- When the medium supports it, render the swim-lane visually (actors as rows, steps as cells); otherwise per-step list with explicit `Actor: A_n` tags.
- Avoid causal-explanation framing throughout (the mode is descriptive process documentation; causal-overreach escalates to T4).
