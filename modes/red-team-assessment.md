## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Going deeper in Red Team (Assessment) means attacking from inside the artifact for the user's own benefit: hidden assumptions (what does the artifact assume that isn't explicitly stated, and would the artifact survive if that assumption is wrong); understated costs (what costs, risks, or downsides does the artifact name only briefly or not at all); missing stakeholders (whose interests, response, or capacity does the artifact not account for); internal logical gaps (steps that don't follow, claims unsupported by cited evidence, requirements that contradict each other); and steps that assume away the hard part (places where the artifact's structure brushes past the actual difficulty). Apply the sycophantic-inverse self-check before declaring any vulnerability: would a committed opponent actually use this attack, grounded in the artifact's specifics? If the only objection is "but what if X were different" without anchoring in the artifact, drop it. Honest attack failure is more valuable than manufactured findings — and pulled punches (softening real vulnerabilities to spare the user) is a graver failure than over-attack, because the assessment's purpose is to surface what the user needs to fix.

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Widening the lens in assessment means attacking from outside the artifact while keeping the operation focused on what the user needs to fix: adversarial use cases (how would a hostile actor exploit this; what abuse vectors did the author not model); failure modes (under what conditions does the artifact break; what operating-envelope boundaries are undocumented); second-order blowback (who or what reacts to deployment in unpredicted ways — counter-moves, displaced costs, regulatory responses, market reactions). Same sycophantic-inverse self-check as Depth: every finding requires artifact-specific grounding, not hypothetical pressure that doesn't anchor in the deployment context. Each external-surface vulnerability also needs a fix-recommendation: surfacing a vulnerability without telling the user what to do about it leaves the assessment incomplete.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Red Team (Assessment) stress-tests a named artifact for the user's own benefit before they commit or ship: vulnerabilities rank by severity (Showstopper / Major / Caveat) for fix-prioritisation, each paired with an actionable fix recommendation and fix-feasibility tag. It is distinct from red-team-advocate (the same territory's counterpart — builds a case for an external audience ranked by persuasive force; assessment is the safer default when external audience is not in the picture), from steelman-construction (direct opposite — strongest case FOR the artifact), and from T7 pre-mortem-fragility (audits structural fragility regardless of adversary presence; assessment models a hostile actor specifically).

**Procedure.**

1. Run the Input Sufficiency Protocol before attacking — identifiable artifact, bounded scope, sufficient specificity; emit a three-part redirect rather than attacking thin material.
2. Declare stance at top: `Stance: assessment.`
3. Restate the artifact in brief with quotes where possible — vulnerabilities anchor here.
4. Attack from inside the artifact (Depth): hidden assumptions, understated costs, missing stakeholders, internal logical gaps, steps that assume away the hard part.
5. Attack from outside the artifact (Breadth): adversarial use cases, failure modes, second-order blowback, regulatory or market responses.
6. Apply the sycophantic-inverse self-check — would a committed opponent actually use this, grounded in the artifact's specifics? Drop attacks that fail.
7. Tag each finding with Severity (Showstopper / Major / Caveat), Surface (Internal / External), and a Why-this-is-real grounding (quoted where possible).
8. Pair every vulnerability with an actionable fix recommendation and a fix-feasibility tag (user-implementable / requires-outside-resources / structural-redesign-needed).
9. Disclose attack classes attempted that produced no findings — empty Attack-Failure Disclosure signals shallow attack.
10. When no Major/Showstopper findings exist, declare the severity floor explicitly — the anti-nitpick guard, not a failure to attack.
11. Flag any framework-level drift and surface paradigm-suspension as the sideways-route.
12. Resist pulled-punches (softening real vulnerabilities to spare the user) and severity-inflation (promoting Caveats to Major to manufacture productive-attack feel).

**Goal.** Produce an adversarial vulnerability assessment — a structured audit of the user's own artifact, ranked by severity for fix-prioritisation, with actionable fixes and fix-feasibility per finding.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — finding grounding.** Does each vulnerability have artifact-specific grounding (Why this is real with quotes where possible), or are findings manufactured? Failure mode if unmet: `nitpick-trap`.
- **CQ2 — severity calibration.** Is severity calibration honest, or has severity been inflated (or deflated)? Failure mode if unmet: `severity-inflation`.
- **CQ3 — fix actionability.** Is each fix recommendation actionable by the user — does the user know what to do next? Failure mode if unmet: `fix-handwaving`.
- **CQ4 — fix-feasibility.** Has fix-feasibility been assessed per vulnerability, distinguishing fixes the user can implement from those requiring outside resources? Failure mode if unmet: `fix-handwaving`.
- **CQ5 — Attack-Failure Disclosure.** Does the section name attack classes attempted that produced no findings, or is it empty? Failure mode if unmet: `shallow-attack`.
- **CQ6 — framework-vs-artifact discipline.** Does the attack stay within the artifact's framework, or drift into framework-level critique? Failure mode if unmet: `framework-attack-trap`.
- **CQ7 — override flag.** If Input Sufficiency override was invoked, is every finding flagged as low-specificity / generic? Failure mode if unmet: `fabricated-override-trap`.

A passing output has stance declared at top ("Stance: assessment"), every vulnerability tagged with severity (Showstopper/Major/Caveat) and surface (Internal/External) and grounded with quotes where possible, every vulnerability paired with an actionable fix recommendation and a fix-feasibility note, residual uncertainties named, Attack-Failure Disclosure present with at least one disclosed attack class, severity-floor declaration when no Major/Showstopper findings exist, and output structure matching the assessment shape throughout.

**Named failure modes.**

- *pulled-punches* — mode avoids hard truths to spare the user; vulnerabilities softened, severity deflated, real risks dressed as "minor considerations".
- *severity-inflation* — severity profile inflated above what artifact's actual flaws warrant; severity-floor declaration skipped despite no Major/Showstopper findings.
- *fix-handwaving* — fix recommendations are vague without artifact-specific actionable instructions or feasibility assessment.
- *nitpick-trap* — findings emitted without artifact-specific grounding; cosmetic-level objections promoted to vulnerability status.
- *sycophantic-inverse-trap* — performing hostility rather than analysing; findings fail the "would a committed opponent actually use this" check.
- *straw-target-trap* — attack targets a weakened version of the artifact; doesn't apply to artifact as written.
- *framework-attack-trap* — attack drifts into critique of the framework the artifact rests on rather than the artifact within it.
- *manufacture-on-revise-trap* — reviser added findings without new evidence; sycophantic-inverse drift at revision stage.
- *fabricated-override-trap* — override invoked but findings not flagged as low-specificity / generic; user loses signal that attack was run on thin material.
- *shallow-attack* — Attack-Failure Disclosure empty or missing; mode failed to attack thoroughly.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to add artifact-specific grounding (Why this is real with quotes) wherever vulnerabilities lack it; drop findings that fail the grounding check rather than weaken the standard. Revise to declare the severity floor honestly when no Major/Showstopper findings exist — a "the artifact is solid" sentence is the anti-Nitpick guard, not a failure to attack. Revise to pair every vulnerability with an actionable fix recommendation and feasibility note where these are missing. Revise to remove pulled-punch language (softening real risks to spare the user) wherever it has crept in: the assessment's contract is honest vulnerability surfacing for fix-prioritisation, not comfort. Resist revising toward more findings — the mode's purpose is honest adversarial pressure ranked by severity, not finding-quota satisfaction. The reviser may consolidate, clarify, or strengthen existing findings; may NOT manufacture new findings without new evidence (manufacture-on-revise-trap is a Tier A failure).

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **an assessment-stance vulnerability audit: stance declaration, artifact-restatement atom, vulnerability atoms ranked by severity (Showstopper > Major > Caveat) with surface tag (Internal / External), fix-recommendation atoms paired with fix-feasibility notes, residual-uncertainty atoms, Attack-Failure Disclosure atoms naming attack classes attempted that produced nothing, and severity-floor declaration when applicable**. The atoms are:

1. **Stance-declaration atom.** A single line: `Stance: assessment.` The deliverable's posture is surface-vulnerabilities-for-fix, not built-the-case-against-for-external-audience. Mixing in advocate-stance shapes (audience model, persuasive-force ranking, suggested phrasing) is a routing failure.

2. **Artifact-restatement atom.** The artifact in brief, quoted where possible.

3. **Vulnerability atoms — ranked by severity.** Each atom carries: a `Finding [N]` label, a severity tag (`Showstopper` / `Major` / `Caveat`), a surface tag (`Internal` / `External`), a `Why this is real` grounding (with quoted artifact text where possible), and `What breaks if exploited`. Pulled-punches is the named failure mode the consolidator watches for; vulnerabilities softened, severity deflated, or real risks dressed as "minor considerations" get reshaped. Severity-inflation is the mirror failure; severity profile inflated above what artifact flaws warrant gets reshaped. Nitpick-trap, straw-target-trap, sycophantic-inverse-trap, and no-fabrication-violation also apply.

4. **Fix-recommendation atoms — per vulnerability.** Each atom carries: an *actionable* fix (specific change the user could implement), a fix-feasibility note (`user-implementable` / `requires-outside-resources` / `structural-redesign-needed`). Fix-handwaving is the named failure mode; vague fixes ("improve documentation", "consider stakeholders") without artifact-specific instructions get reshaped.

5. **Residual-uncertainty atoms.** Where the assessment depends on facts or framings that may shift, the uncertainty surfaces explicitly.

6. **Attack-Failure Disclosure atoms.** Each atom names: an attack class attempted that produced no findings, and why. Shallow-attack is the named failure mode; empty disclosure indicates the attack was not thorough.

7. **Severity-floor declaration atom — when applicable.** When no Major or Showstopper findings exist, a labelled `**Severity floor:** the artifact is solid at the Major/Showstopper level. Caveats below are surface-level rather than structural.` line is the anti-nitpick guard, not a failure to attack.

8. **Framework-attack-trap flag — when applicable.** Where attacks drifted into critique of the framework the artifact rests on, the flag is preserved and a sideways-route to paradigm-suspension is surfaced.

9. **Override-flag — when applicable.** Where the Input Sufficiency Protocol was overridden, every finding carries an explicit low-specificity / generic flag. Fabricated-override-trap is the named failure mode.

10. **Manufacture-on-revise flag — when applicable.** Where revision added findings without new evidence, the flag is preserved.

11. **Confidence per finding.** Each major claim carries confidence (separate from severity — confidence is about whether the vulnerability is real; severity is about how bad it is if real).

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut:**

- **Pulled punches** — hard truths softened to spare the user; severity deflated; real risks dressed as "minor considerations".
- **Severity inflation** — Caveats promoted to Major to manufacture sense of productive attack; severity-floor declaration skipped to avoid honesty about a solid artifact.
- **Fix handwaving** — vague fixes without artifact-specific actionable instructions or feasibility.
- **Nitpick** — cosmetic-level objections promoted to vulnerability status.
- **Sycophantic-inverse** — performing hostility without grounding; would a committed opponent actually use this?
- **Straw-target / fabrication** — attacks on distorted or fabricated artifact-claims.
- **Framework-attack drift** — critiquing the framework rather than the artifact within it.
- **Empty Attack-Failure Disclosure** — shallow attack; the user can't tell what was attempted and didn't land.
- **Advocate-stance bleed** — audience model, persuasive-force ranking, suggested phrasing — these belong in red-team-advocate.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **Severity tiers** — Showstopper / Major / Caveat distinctions calibrate honestly; the three tiers do not blur into one another.
- **Internal-vs-External surface distinction** — internal-logic vulnerabilities and external (deployment-context, adversarial-use, second-order) vulnerabilities operate differently; both surfaces are scanned.
- **Stream disagreement about severity** — when streams rated the same vulnerability differently, the disagreement is preserved with reasoning for both.
- **Fix-feasibility distinctions** — user-implementable / outside-resources / structural-redesign-needed are not blurred; the user needs to know what they can act on.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: stance declaration appears in opening line ("Stance: assessment"); artifact restatement quotes where possible; every vulnerability has Finding [N] label, Severity (Showstopper/Major/Caveat), Surface (Internal/External), Why this is real grounded in artifact specifics, What breaks if exploited, Fix recommendation, and Fix feasibility note; vulnerabilities are ranked by severity (worst-first) not by surface or order-of-discovery; residual uncertainties section present; Attack-Failure Disclosure present with at least one disclosed attack class; severity-floor literal sentence present when applicable (no Major/Showstopper found); framework-level critiques flagged out-of-scope and routed to paradigm-suspension; override-flag present on every finding when Input Sufficiency override was invoked; no new findings introduced during revision without new evidence; no advocate-stance shapes (audience-model, persuasive-force ranking, suggested phrasing) present. The seven critical questions are addressable from the output.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is an **adversarial vulnerability assessment** — a structured audit of the user's own artifact, ranked by severity for fix-prioritisation, with actionable fixes and fix-feasibility per finding. Place the consolidated-corpus atoms into the following sections, in this order:

1. **Stance declaration.** First line: `**Stance: assessment.**` Verbatim; downstream sections honour the assessment-stance contract.

2. **Artifact restatement.** One paragraph restating the artifact in brief, with quoted passages where possible.

3. **Vulnerabilities ranked by severity.** Numbered list, **Showstopper first, then Major, then Caveat**. Each: `**Finding [N]** — Severity: [Showstopper / Major / Caveat]. Surface: [Internal / External]. Why this is real: [grounded in artifact specifics with quote where possible]. What breaks if exploited: [...].`

4. **Fix recommendations per vulnerability.** Per finding, one labelled sub-block: `**Finding [N] — Fix recommendation:** [specific actionable change]. **Fix feasibility:** [user-implementable / requires-outside-resources / structural-redesign-needed]. Tradeoff if implemented: [...].`

5. **Residual uncertainties.** Bulleted list of facts or framings the assessment depends on that may shift.

6. **Attack-Failure Disclosure.** Bulleted list of attack classes attempted that produced no findings. Each: `**Attack class attempted:** [...]. **Why it produced no findings:** [...].` At least one entry; empty disclosures get reshaped to surface what was actually tried.

7. **Severity floor declaration (when applicable).** When no Major or Showstopper findings exist: `**Severity floor:** the artifact is solid at the Major/Showstopper level. The findings above are Caveats — surface-level rather than structural. The assessment did not pull punches; the artifact survived the attack.`

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 7.
- Severity vocabulary (`Showstopper` / `Major` / `Caveat`) appears verbatim. Ranking is severity-first: Showstoppers always lead, regardless of whether they are Internal or External.
- Fix-feasibility vocabulary (`user-implementable` / `requires-outside-resources` / `structural-redesign-needed`) appears verbatim — the user needs to know what they can act on.
- The severity-floor declaration (section 7) is *not* a sign of attack failure when honestly applied to a solid artifact. Omitting it to avoid acknowledging a clean assessment is a form of severity-inflation, reshaped at this layer.
- When the framework-attack-trap flag survived, the deliverable closes section 3 with: `**Framework-attack flag:** [N] finding(s) target the framework the artifact rests on rather than the artifact within it. Sideways-route to paradigm-suspension if framework critique is warranted; otherwise these findings get reshaped to stay within-framework.`
- When the override-flag survived, each finding in section 3 carries `**[low-specificity — override invoked]**` so the user knows the limitation.
- When the manufacture-on-revise flag survived, the deliverable carries a top-line note: `**Note: the revision stage added [N] finding(s) without new evidence. These have been flagged or removed.**`
- Advocate-stance shapes (audience model, persuasive-force ranking, suggested phrasing) are reshaped/removed at this layer; they belong in red-team-advocate.

## CAVEATS AND OPEN DEBATES

This mode and its sibling `red-team-advocate` were parsed from the original `red-team` mode per Decision D (parsing principle: when a single mode-id maps to two distinct output contracts with different ranking criteria and different audience modeling, parse into separate modes sharing a foundational lens). The shared lens is `cia-tradecraft-red-team`, which captures the foundational adversarial-actor-modeling discipline both modes draw from. The parse rationale: assessment ranks vulnerabilities by severity for the user's own fix-prioritisation; advocate ranks attacks by persuasive force against an external audience for argument-brief use. These are different operations — different ranking criteria, different audience modelling, different output contracts — so they live as sibling modes in T15 rather than as stances within a single mode. The earlier internal `stance_protocol` (assessment vs advocate dispatch within one mode_id) was retired with this parse: disambiguation now lives between modes, not within. Routing relies on the within-territory tree's secondary branch under "want adversarial — for own decision (assessment) or for external use (advocate)?" with `red-team-assessment` as the default when ambiguous and an escalation hook to `red-team-advocate`.
