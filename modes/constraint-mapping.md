## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Depth in Constraint Mapping is the testability of success and failure conditions per alternative. A thin pass enumerates pros and cons in vague terms; a substantive pass states each success condition as a testable proposition with a threshold or observable, and traces the cost of each forfeit concretely. Test depth by asking: could each alternative's success be falsified by a specific observation? Each alternative carries the same four sub-sections (success conditions / failure conditions / uniquely gained / forfeited), with identical analytical depth.

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Breadth in Constraint Mapping is the catalog of alternatives, including any the user has not named. Widen the lens to identify ≥3 alternatives (or 2 in genuinely binary cases), generate hybrid or sequencing strategies, and surface no-lose elements (actions valuable regardless of choice). Breadth markers: alternatives include at least one the user did not initially name; at least one no-lose element is identified; hybrid or sequencing options are considered.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Constraint Mapping is a light, deterministic decision-terrain mapping — alternatives are enumerated, each carries a parallel four-slot analysis (success conditions / failure conditions / uniquely gained / forfeited) with testable propositions, and no-lose elements are surfaced. It is distinct from decision-under-uncertainty (probability-and-time-weighted depth-thorough sibling), multi-criteria-decision (multi-criteria weighting complexity sibling), decision-architecture (depth-molecular sibling integrating stakeholders + risk), and benefits-analysis (evaluates ONE proposal, not a choice among alternatives). Its contract is mapping the terrain, not making the choice — choice-collapse is the load-bearing failure mode.

**Procedure.**

1. State the decision and its constraints once at the head — hard (must-satisfy) and soft (would-prefer-to-satisfy), each labelled.
2. Enumerate alternatives — at least three (or two in genuinely binary cases with explicit pro/con-form tag and reason). At least one alternative must be analyst-generated to widen the option space beyond what the user brought.
3. For each alternative render four parallel slots:
   - success conditions — testable propositions with threshold or observable, never vague abstractions ("completes within 90 days at ≤$50K," not "improves efficiency")
   - failure conditions — testable propositions naming what would falsify success
   - uniquely gained — what this alternative provides that others do not
   - forfeited — what this alternative costs that others retain
4. Render the four slots at parallel analytical depth across alternatives. Asymmetric depth (one alternative noticeably deeper than others) is the analyst tilting the map; honest asymmetry (an alternative genuinely thinner because less viable) is named explicitly rather than padded.
5. Surface no-lose elements — actions valuable regardless of which alternative is chosen. Each passes the cross-alternative-applicability check (valuable under A1 *and* A2 *and* A3); single-alternative items are misclassified gains.
6. Choose a comparison format with reason — strategic 2×2 (orthogonal criteria), four-quadrant per-alternative table (four slots as grid), or pro/con tree (binary). Default-choice without case-fit reason is its own failure.
7. Identify cross-alternative differentiating factors — the dimensions on which alternatives diverge most sharply.
8. Leave the recommendation slot empty unless the user explicitly asked for a final choice. Phrasings like "the clear winner is" are choice-collapse residue.

**Goal.** Produce a structured matrix of alternatives with per-alternative four-slot analysis at parallel depth, surfaced no-lose elements, format-justified comparison, and an explicit empty recommendation slot unless the user requested a choice.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — alternative breadth.** Are at least three alternatives mapped, including any the user has not named? Failure mode if unmet: `false-dichotomy`.
- **CQ2 — symmetric analytical depth.** Are success and failure conditions stated as testable propositions for each alternative, with identical analytical depth across alternatives? Failure mode if unmet: `advocacy-asymmetry`.
- **CQ3 — no-lose elements surfaced.** Have no-lose elements (actions valuable regardless of which alternative is chosen) been surfaced explicitly? Failure mode if unmet: `missed-no-lose`.
- **CQ4 — choice abstention (load-bearing).** Does the mode map the choice terrain without making the choice for the user, unless explicitly asked? Failure mode if unmet: `choice-collapse`.

A passing output maps ≥3 alternatives (including ≥1 analyst-generated), states each success/failure condition as a testable proposition with threshold or observable, renders the four slots at parallel depth across alternatives, surfaces ≥1 no-lose element passing the cross-applicability check, names the format choice with reason, and leaves the recommendation slot empty unless the user requested a final choice.

**Named failure modes.**

- *false-dichotomy* — only two alternatives mapped when ≥3 are viable, or a binary framing masks the option space.
- *advocacy-asymmetry* — one alternative receives substantially deeper analysis than others.
- *abstraction-trap* — success or failure conditions stated as vague abstractions, not testable propositions with thresholds or observables.
- *choice-collapse* — mode delivers a single recommended alternative when the user asked for the terrain mapped.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to add alternatives until ≥3 (or switch to pro/con form for genuinely binary choices). Revise to equalise analytical depth across alternatives. Revise to convert vague conditions into testable propositions. Resist revising toward a final choice if the user asked for the terrain mapped — the mode's contract is mapping, not deciding. Resist revising toward consensus framing — the mode honours genuine tradeoffs.

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **alternative atoms with symmetric four-slot per-alternative analysis (success / failure / gain / forfeit), plus no-lose elements and cross-alternative comparison atoms**. The four slots are the load-bearing parallel structure; symmetric analytical depth across alternatives is the mode's discipline. The atoms are:

1. **Decision-context atom.** The choice situation, hard constraints, and soft constraints, stated once at the corpus head. Cross-stream paraphrase collapses to one canonical statement.

2. **Alternative atoms — at least three.** Each alternative carries four parallel sub-atoms:
   - **Success conditions** — testable propositions with thresholds or observables (not vague abstractions; abstraction-trap residue does not survive)
   - **Failure conditions** — testable propositions naming what would falsify the alternative's success
   - **Uniquely gained** — what this alternative provides that the others do not
   - **Forfeited** — what this alternative costs that the others retain

   At least three alternatives must survive cross-stream dedup (CQ1, false-dichotomy failure mode), unless the choice is genuinely binary in which case the corpus carries an explicit "binary choice — pro/con form" atom with the reason. At least one alternative must be analyst-generated (the user did not initially name it).

3. **Analytical-depth-symmetry atom.** A corpus-level atom flags the analytical depth across alternatives. Advocacy-asymmetry is the named failure mode; when one alternative receives substantially deeper analysis than others, the corpus carries the asymmetry as a finding (with reason — is the deeper-analyzed alternative genuinely better-supported, or has the analyst tilted toward it?). Symmetric depth is the default expectation; asymmetric depth requires explicit justification.

4. **No-lose-element atoms.** Each carries: action statement, value-rationale, and which alternatives it applies under (the test of a no-lose element is that it's valuable across all alternatives — single-alternative-only "no-lose" items are misclassified gains). At least one no-lose element atom must survive or the breadth marker is unmet.

5. **Cross-alternative-comparison atoms.** Each names a differentiating factor — the dimensions on which alternatives diverge most sharply. These are not restatements of the per-alternative slots; they are the comparison-level findings (e.g., "alternatives A and B both succeed on cost but fail on time-to-implement; alternative C inverts this").

6. **Format-choice atom.** The format selected for the deliverable corpus organization — 2×2 matrix (when alternatives plot cleanly on two orthogonal criteria), four-quadrant per-alternative table (when the four slots are the structuring grid), or pro/con tree (when the choice is genuinely binary). The format-choice atom carries the reason — why this format fits this case better than the alternatives.

7. **Choice-recommendation atom — conditional.** Empty by default. Populated only when the user explicitly asked for a recommendation (not just a terrain map). Choice-collapse is the named failure mode; an unsolicited recommendation invalidates the mode's contract, which is to map the terrain.

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut during the bloat strip:**

- **Alternative-paraphrase loops** — both streams may state the same alternative under different framings ("invest in X" vs "allocate resources to X"). Single canonical statement survives.
- **Vague-condition residue** — success or failure conditions stated as "improves outcomes" or "reduces risk" without threshold or observable. Abstraction-trap residue; either a testable proposition replaces the vague version or the condition does not survive into the corpus.
- **Per-slot paraphrase** — same gain or forfeit stated under different wordings. Single slot atom survives.
- **Choice-collapse residue** — phrasings like "the best option appears to be", "I would recommend", "the clear winner". Choice-collapse residue does not survive unless the user asked for a recommendation.
- **Asymmetric-padding** — one alternative's four slots padded with weak content to match the depth of another's. The honest finding is the asymmetry, not the padding; padding does not survive.
- **Restated-differentiating-factors** — both streams may state the same differentiating factor under different framings. Single comparison atom survives.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **Genuinely different alternative sets** — when the two streams enumerated different alternatives (with overlap but not identity), preserve all surviving alternatives. The mode's breadth marker is generating alternatives the user did not name; both streams' analyst-generated alternatives are evidence of breadth, not redundancy.
- **Real depth-asymmetry across alternatives** — when one alternative is genuinely thinner because it's less viable (rather than because the analyst neglected it), preserve the asymmetric depth and carry the reason in the analytical-depth-symmetry atom. Forcing symmetric length onto genuinely asymmetric viability is its own failure.
- **Format-choice disagreement** — when one stream selected 2×2 and the other selected pro/con tree (or four-quadrant table), preserve the disagreement in the format-choice atom with both formats' reasons. The format choice is consequential for what the deliverable looks like; the consolidator must not silently pick.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: ≥3 alternatives mapped (or 2 in pro/con form for genuinely binary choices); success and failure conditions stated as testable propositions per alternative; analytical depth symmetric across alternatives; no-lose elements explicitly called out; the mode does not make the final choice unless the user explicitly asked. The four critical questions are addressed in the output.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is a **structured matrix of alternatives with per-alternative four-slot analysis (success / failure / gain / forfeit), no-lose elements, and cross-alternative comparison**. Place the consolidated-corpus atoms into the following sections, in this order:

1. **Decision context and constraints.** Two short blocks at the top:
   - **Decision:** the choice situation, in one or two sentences.
   - **Constraints:** numbered list of hard constraints (must-satisfy) and soft constraints (would-prefer-to-satisfy), each labelled `[hard]` or `[soft]`.

2. **Alternatives at a glance.** A bulleted list of A1, A2, A3, … (canonical IDs) with one-line characterizations. At minimum three alternatives (or two in pro/con form for genuinely binary choices, with explicit `[binary choice — pro/con form]` tag and reason). At least one alternative is tagged `[analyst-generated]` for breadth marker.

3. **Per-alternative analysis — symmetric four-slot.** For each alternative A1, A2, A3, …, render a block with these four parallel slots in this exact order:
   - **Success conditions** — testable propositions with thresholds or observables. No vague abstractions.
   - **Failure conditions** — testable propositions naming what would falsify success.
   - **Uniquely gained** — what this alternative provides that others do not.
   - **Forfeited** — what this alternative costs that others retain.

   The four slots render at parallel depth across all alternatives. Asymmetric depth (one alternative noticeably deeper than others) renders only with explicit reason flagged in section 5.

4. **Cross-alternative comparison.** Choose ONE of three format options based on the choice space (and name the choice):
   - **Strategic 2×2** — when alternatives plot cleanly on two orthogonal criteria. Render as a 2×2 grid with axes named, alternatives positioned in quadrants.
   - **Four-quadrant per-alternative table** — when each alternative's four slots are the structuring grid. Render as a markdown table: alternatives as columns, four slots as rows.
   - **Pro/con tree** — when the choice is genuinely binary. Render as two parallel columns with pros/cons for each side.

   Open the section with: `Format: [chosen format] — reason: [why this format fits this case better].`

5. **Analytical-depth-symmetry note.** One sentence flagging whether alternatives received symmetric depth. When asymmetric, name the reason explicitly: "Asymmetric depth: A3 is shallower because [reason — e.g., low viability, less information available]." Padding to artificial symmetry is the named failure mode; honest asymmetry is preserved.

6. **No-lose elements.** Bulleted list of actions valuable regardless of which alternative is chosen. Each bullet: `[Action] — value: [why valuable]. Applies under: [which alternatives — should be all].` Single-alternative-only items are misclassified gains and do not appear here.

7. **Cross-alternative differentiating factors.** Bulleted list of the dimensions on which alternatives diverge most sharply. Each bullet: `[Differentiating factor]: A1 [position], A2 [position], A3 [position].` These are comparison-level findings, distinct from the per-alternative slots.

8. **Recommendation — conditional.** Empty by default. Render as: `Recommendation: empty (user did not request a final choice — Constraint Mapping maps the terrain, does not decide).` Populate only when the user explicitly asked for a recommendation.

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 8.
- Alternative IDs (A1, A2, …) are referenced consistently throughout once introduced.
- The four-slot template in section 3 renders as four bolded sub-headers per alternative, never collapsed into prose paragraphs that lose the parallel structure.
- The format-choice in section 4 is operative — choose one and commit; the deliverable should not carry both a 2×2 grid and a pro/con tree.
- Hard vs soft constraint tags are explicit; do not list constraints without classification.
