## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Depth in Synthesis is the degree to which proposed connections survive the structural-vs-metaphorical test. A thin pass names parallels by shared vocabulary; a substantive pass states the mechanism that makes each parallel a structural correspondence rather than a surface analogy. Test depth by asking: could the proposed connection be falsified by examining a case where one framework's mechanism operates and the other's does not? If yes, the connection is structural. If the connection only restates that "both X and Y address related themes," it is surface.

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Breadth in Synthesis is the catalog of candidate connections considered before selecting which survive the mechanism test. Generate at minimum three candidate connections, including at least one non-obvious. Widen the lens to cross-domain analogical scans and to less-obvious correspondences (units of analysis, generative mechanisms, failure modes). Breadth markers: the synthesis surveys the productive tensions as well as the convergences, and explicitly names what it leaves out.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Synthesis is integrative-stance cross-domain analysis that examines two (or more) bodies of knowledge as peer roots, identifying mechanism-tested structural correspondences and productive tensions between them. It is read in the structural-isomorphism-detection tradition (Hofstadter-style correspondence, Gentner's analogical-mapping theory). The mode is distinct from dialectical-analysis (T12 sibling that drives thesis through antithesis to sublation — adversarial commitment), from frame-comparison (T9, paradigm-level frame-vs-frame), and from steelman-construction (T15, the strongest version of one position). Synthesis is neutral examination, not advocacy — both frameworks survive in their own terms.

**Procedure.**

1. Identify the frameworks as peer roots — each gets equal structural rank with lineage, units of analysis, generative mechanism, and known internal failure modes.
2. Generate at minimum three candidate cross-links, including at least one non-obvious — cast widely across surface and structural levels.
3. Apply the mechanism test to each candidate — what case would falsify the parallel if one framework's mechanism operated and the other's did not? Cross-links resting on shared vocabulary or evocative similarity fail this test.
4. Confirm surviving cross-links and migrate failed candidates to ruled-out cross-links — both visible in the deliverable as evidence of breadth and discipline.
5. Surface at least one productive tension — a place where the frameworks pull in different analytical directions and the tension itself is the finding (not bloat to smooth over).
6. Produce the emergent insight — a claim neither framework alone produces, with explicit attribution of what each framework contributed.
7. Name limitations — domains or conditions where the synthesis breaks down, where cross-links fail to apply, or where the frameworks genuinely disagree without productive tension.
8. Maintain peer-root parity throughout — no reduction language ("X is really a kind of Y"), no own-vocabulary translation that smuggles in endorsement of one framework.
9. Assign per-cross-link confidence (high when mechanism evidence is direct; lower when conjectural extrapolation).

**Goal.** Produce a structured peer-root synthesis — two or more frameworks at parallel rank with mechanism-tested cross-links, productive tensions, an emergent insight requiring both frameworks, ruled-out candidates surfaced, and limitations named.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — mechanism-level vs surface (load-bearing).** Are the proposed connections structural correspondences at the mechanism level, or surface analogies? Failure mode if unmet: `false-synthesis`.
- **CQ2 — peer-root parity (load-bearing).** Do both frameworks survive as peer roots, or has one been reduced to a special case of the other? Failure mode if unmet: `reduction-trap`.
- **CQ3 — productive tensions surfaced.** Have productive tensions been named explicitly, or smoothed over to produce apparent harmony? Failure mode if unmet: `harmony-trap`.
- **CQ4 — emergent insight requires both.** Does the synthesis produce an emergent insight unavailable from either framework alone? Failure mode if unmet: `restatement-only`.

A passing output presents both frameworks at peer-root parity, carries at least one mechanism-tested cross-link with explicit falsification condition, surfaces ruled-out candidates as evidence of breadth, names at least one productive tension, produces an emergent insight that requires both frameworks (with attribution per framework), and names at least one limitation.

**Named failure modes.**

- *false-synthesis* — cross-link rests on shared vocabulary or evocative similarity rather than mechanism-level correspondence.
- *reduction-trap* — one framework appears as a special case of the other rather than as a peer root.
- *harmony-trap* — no productive tensions named; frameworks rendered as fully compatible.
- *no-cross-link* — two separate trees presented with no inter-framework connection.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to add mechanism evidence where the draft asserts connection by vocabulary alone. Revise to surface tensions where the draft has smoothed them. Resist revising toward apparent harmony — productive tensions are findings, not failures. Resist revising toward endorsing one framework — Synthesis is neutral examination, not advocacy. If a cross-link cannot be defended at the mechanism level, remove it and note in prose that the connection is superficial.

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **peer-root framework atoms bridged by mechanism-level cross-link atoms, with productive-tension atoms, emergent-insight atom, and limitations atoms**. The peer-root status of both frameworks is load-bearing; the mechanism test on each cross-link is the discipline that distinguishes synthesis from surface analogy. The atoms are:

1. **Framework atoms — peer roots.** Each carries: framework name, lineage / tradition, units of analysis, generative mechanism, and known failure modes. Both frameworks appear at the same structural rank in the corpus; reduction-trap is the named failure mode, and treating one framework as a special case of the other is its corpus signature. The corpus carries both as roots even when one is more developed or familiar.

2. **Cross-link atoms — mechanism-tested only.** Each carries: source-framework atom, target-framework atom, the proposed correspondence, and the **mechanism-test result** — what makes this a structural correspondence rather than a surface analogy. The mechanism test asks: could the cross-link be falsified by a case where one framework's mechanism operates and the other's does not? Cross-links that fail the test do not survive as cross-links — they survive as ruled-out cross-link atoms (see item 6). False-synthesis is the named failure mode; mechanism-untested cross-links are its corpus signature.

3. **Productive-tension atoms.** Each names a real tension between the frameworks — a place where they pull in different analytical directions and the tension is itself productive (not bloat to smooth over). Each tension atom carries: the position from each framework, the tension's load-bearing reason, and what the tension reveals about the synthesis space. Harmony-trap is the named failure mode; corpus with cross-links but no productive-tension atoms is its signature. At least one productive-tension atom must survive or harmony-trap fires.

4. **Emergent-insight atom.** A single corpus-level atom names the insight unavailable from either framework alone — what the synthesis produces that is not a restatement of either source. Restatement-only is the named failure mode; an emergent-insight atom that the consolidator could have written by reading just one framework is its corpus signature. The atom must name what's new and what made it visible (which cross-link or tension produced it).

5. **Limitations atoms.** Each names a domain or condition where the synthesis breaks down — where the cross-links fail to apply or the frameworks genuinely disagree without productive tension. Limitations atoms guard against scope-overreach and signal where downstream use of the synthesis should pause.

6. **Ruled-out cross-link atoms.** Each names a candidate cross-link that failed the mechanism test, with: the proposed correspondence, the case that falsified it, and the reason it's surface rather than structural. The ruled-out atoms are evidence of breadth (at least three candidate connections considered per the breadth marker) and discipline (failed candidates are surfaced as ruled-out rather than dropped silently). At minimum the breadth pass considered three candidates; the ratio of cross-link to ruled-out atoms is a finding about the synthesis's solidity.

7. **Confidence per cross-link.** Confidence markers attach to individual cross-link atoms (high when mechanism evidence is direct; lower when the mechanism test depends on conjectural extrapolation). When the two streams assigned different confidences, audit conservatism applies.

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut during the bloat strip:**

- **Vocabulary-shared cross-links** — connections asserted because the frameworks share a term ("both use the word 'system'", "both reference structure"). False-synthesis residue; either a mechanism-level evidence atom is added (and the cross-link survives) or the candidate migrates to ruled-out cross-links.
- **Harmony-padding** — phrases like "the frameworks beautifully complement each other", "they share a deep affinity". Harmony-trap residue; the corpus carries productive-tension atoms rather than affinity language.
- **Reduction-language residue** — "X is really a kind of Y", "Y is the more general case of X". Reduction-trap residue; the corpus carries both as peer roots, and reduction language either gets reframed as "X and Y address the same problem from different mechanism-paths" or is dropped.
- **Restatement-only emergent insight** — an "emergent insight" that the consolidator could have written by reading just one framework. Restatement-only residue; the emergent-insight atom must require both frameworks to produce.
- **Tension-as-failure framing** — phrases that treat productive tensions as flaws or open problems to resolve. The tensions are findings; reframing them as failures-of-synthesis is its own failure mode. The corpus carries them with "productive tension" framing.
- **Cross-link inflation** — many shallow cross-links rather than fewer mechanism-tested ones. The bloat strip prunes shallow cross-links; the corpus carries fewer-but-mechanism-tested over many-but-vocabulary-tested.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **Different mechanism-test results for the same cross-link** — when one stream judged a cross-link mechanism-tested-passing and the other judged it failing, preserve both judgments. The disagreement is consequential for whether the cross-link survives or migrates to ruled-out; the consolidator must not silently pick. The corpus carries the cross-link with both judgments and lets downstream verify.
- **Different productive tensions surfaced** — when streams identified different real tensions between the frameworks, preserve all surviving tensions as parallel atoms. Multiple tensions is a sign of breadth, not redundancy.
- **Limitations disagreement** — when streams disagreed on whether the synthesis applies to a particular domain, preserve both judgments as a contested-limitation atom. Whether the synthesis extends to that domain is itself a finding.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: both frameworks present as peer roots; ≥ 1 cross-link with mechanism evidence; ≥ 1 productive tension named; emergent insight named; ≥ 1 limitation named. Every cross-link's connection survives the mechanism test (could be falsified by a case where one framework's mechanism operates and the other's does not). The four critical questions are addressed in the output.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is a **structured peer-root synthesis: two (or more) frameworks at parallel rank with mechanism-tested cross-links, productive tensions, emergent insight, and limitations**. Place the consolidated-corpus atoms into the following sections, in this order:

1. **Frameworks identified — peer roots.** Two (or more) parallel H3 sub-sections, one per framework. Each sub-section: `**Framework name** — lineage / tradition: [...]. Units of analysis: [...]. Generative mechanism: [the engine the framework uses to produce its insights]. Known failure modes: [the framework's own internal limits, not external critique].` Both frameworks render at the same structural depth — reduction-trap is the named failure mode (treating one as a special case of the other).

2. **Structural parallels — mechanism-tested cross-links.** Numbered list. Each cross-link: `**Cross-link [N]:** [Framework A's element] ↔ [Framework B's element]. Mechanism-test: [what makes this a structural correspondence rather than a surface analogy — i.e., what case would falsify the parallel if one framework's mechanism operated and the other's did not]. Status: confirmed.` At minimum one mechanism-tested cross-link.

3. **Evidence for genuineness.** For each cross-link from section 2, a short block: `Cross-link [N] is genuine because: [specific evidence — domain cases, structural correspondences, or shared inferential moves the cross-link predicts that surface analogy would not]. Falsifying case: [the case that, if it obtained, would refute the cross-link].`

4. **Emergent insight.** A single block (one to three sentences) stating what the synthesis produces that neither framework alone produces. Frame as: `**Emergent insight:** [the claim]. This required both frameworks because: [which framework contributed what aspect, and why neither alone is sufficient].` Restatement-only is the named failure mode; an emergent insight the consolidator could have written by reading just one framework is its corpus signature.

5. **Productive tensions.** Bulleted list. Each tension: `**[Tension name]** — Framework A's position: [...]. Framework B's position: [...]. Why productive: [what the tension reveals about the synthesis space that resolving it would obscure].` At minimum one productive-tension atom; harmony-trap is the named failure mode.

6. **Limitations.** Bulleted list. Each limitation: `**[Limitation]** — domain or condition where the synthesis breaks down: [...]. Reason: [why cross-links fail here, or why the frameworks genuinely disagree without productive tension].`

7. **Ruled-out cross-links.** Bulleted list of candidates that failed the mechanism test. Each: `**[Proposed cross-link]** — failed because: [the case that falsified it]. Why surface, not structural: [reason].` These atoms are evidence of breadth (the synthesis considered candidates and ruled some out).

8. **Confidence per cross-link.** Bulleted list. Each confirmed cross-link gets a confidence marker (high / moderate / low) with reason — high when mechanism evidence is direct; lower when conjectural extrapolation.

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 8.
- Section 1's two framework blocks render at structurally equivalent depth — visual peer-root parity is load-bearing for the neutral-stance posture.
- Cross-link IDs (Cross-link 1, Cross-link 2, ...) are referenced consistently between sections 2, 3, and 8.
- Avoid harmony-padding throughout: "the frameworks beautifully complement each other", "they share a deep affinity" are forbidden phrasings.
- Avoid reduction-language: "X is really a kind of Y", "Y is the more general case of X" — peer-root posture is maintained.
