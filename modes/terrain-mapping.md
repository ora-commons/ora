## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Depth in Terrain Mapping is the precision with which concepts are classified by epistemic status (known / contested / open) and tied to organising structure. A thin pass enumerates concepts; a substantive pass labels each by epistemic status, names the organising framework (hierarchy / hub-and-spoke / network / etc.), and identifies prerequisite chains. Test depth by asking: would the map predict where a newcomer would predictably form a wrong impression from survey-level sources alone? Each concept carries a literal `known` / `contested` / `open` label.

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Breadth in Terrain Mapping is the cartographic completeness — all major sub-areas, schools of thought, and adjacent domains represented. Widen the lens to map the full landscape: settled facts, contested positions (with rival schools represented), open questions, principal actors, and adjacent domains. Generate ≥3 questions the user has not asked but would need to answer to navigate effectively. Breadth markers: at least one cross-link to an adjacent domain (`is_cross_link: true`); ≥3 open questions tied to specific concepts; rival schools represented when domain has them.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Terrain Mapping is a thorough (~5min) Novak-tradition concept-map orientation for a user new to a domain. It is the depth-thorough sibling to quick-orientation (depth-light, ~1min) and domain-induction (depth-molecular, ~10+min) within T14. The mode is descriptive of the domain's concepts, organising structure, and epistemic-status distribution (known / contested / open) — not deep mechanism investigation (deep-clarification, T10) and not open-ended generative exploration (passion-exploration, T20). Its central discipline is honest epistemic-status classification: contested territory rendered as authoritative consensus misleads the newcomer at the worst possible point — when they're forming their map.

**Procedure.**

1. Lock the focus question — the orientation question driving the map, plus the user's starting knowledge level.
2. Inventory concepts (minimum 4) — each with brief characterisation and position in domain structure. Below 4 concepts, surface the sideways-route to deep-clarification.
3. Classify each concept with an epistemic-status tag: `known` (settled in the domain), `contested` (rival schools or active debate), `open` (genuine unknown).
4. Represent rival schools in qualified form where they exist — "the standard view holds X; dissenters argue Y" rather than authoritative single-school framing.
5. Surface at least 3 open questions, each tied to a specific concept in the inventory.
6. Name the organising topology of the domain (`hierarchy` / `hub-and-spoke` / `network` / `chain` / `cluster-bridge`) and prerequisite chains.
7. Add at least one cross-link to an adjacent domain — Novak's marker of integrative understanding. Cross-links appear in their own section, not buried inside concept descriptions.
8. State the boundary explicitly — what's out of scope, adjacent domains touched but not surveyed, sub-areas deferred to follow-on modes.
9. Maintain survey-level discipline — no single sub-area exceeds ~30% of the map. Drilling that breached the threshold gets pulled back to survey breadth.
10. Assign confidence per epistemic-status classification and per cross-link.

**Goal.** Produce a thorough survey-level orientation map — a Novak-tradition concept map with epistemic-status tagging per concept, at least one adjacent-domain cross-link, at least three concept-tied open questions, and an explicit boundary statement.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — epistemic-status honesty (load-bearing).** Are concepts classified as known / contested / open, with no contested position presented as settled (or vice versa)? Failure mode if unmet: `false-consensus`.
- **CQ2 — cross-link present.** Does the map have at least one cross-link to an adjacent domain (Novak's marker of integrative understanding)? Failure mode if unmet: `no-cross-link-trap`.
- **CQ3 — survey-level discipline (load-bearing).** Does the prose stay at survey level rather than drilling into one sub-area (≤30% on any single sub-area)? Failure mode if unmet: `premature-depth`.
- **CQ4 — boundary statement explicit.** Does the map name what is out of scope — its boundary? Failure mode if unmet: `missing-boundary`.

A passing output covers at least 4 concepts each carrying a known/contested/open tag, represents rival schools in qualified form where they exist, names the organising topology, surfaces at least 3 concept-tied open questions, includes at least one adjacent-domain cross-link in its own section, and states the boundary explicitly with what's out of scope.

**Named failure modes.**

- *premature-depth* — prose spends more than 30% on any single sub-area before the full territory is mapped.
- *textbook-trap* — output reproduces a standard overview without known/contested/open separation.
- *false-consensus* — one school of thought's view is presented as the domain consensus when rival schools exist.
- *no-cross-link-trap* — output is a strict tree with no lateral connections to adjacent domains.
- *low-concept-count* — map has fewer than 4 concepts; below threshold, route to deep-clarification.

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to pull back when prose has drilled too deeply into one sub-area. Revise to add epistemic-status labels when missing. Revise to add cross-links when the map is a flat tree. Revise to qualify contested positions presented as settled. Resist revising toward authoritative tone when domain has rival schools — qualify with "the standard view holds X; dissenters argue Y". Resist revising toward exhaustive enumeration when survey breadth is the criterion.

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **a Novak-tradition orientation map: focus-question lock, concept atoms classified by epistemic status (known / contested / open), open-question atoms tied to specific concepts, domain-structure atom naming the organising topology, adjacent-domain cross-link atoms, boundary-statement atom, and survey-level discipline (no single sub-area drilling)**. The atoms are:

1. **Focus-question atom.** The orientation question driving the map. One short sentence; subsequent atoms reference this lock.

2. **Concept atoms — epistemically classified.** Each atom names: one concept with a short characterisation and a literal epistemic-status tag — `known` (settled in the domain), `contested` (rival schools or active debate), `open` (genuine unknown). False-consensus is the named failure mode the consolidator watches for; contested positions presented as settled (or vice versa) get reshaped to honest classification. Textbook-trap is the mirror failure mode; standard overviews without epistemic-status classification get reshaped to per-concept tagging. Low-concept-count is named failure mode for sparse maps (≥4 concepts is the minimum; below threshold, sideways-route to deep-clarification).

3. **Open-question atoms.** Each atom names: an open question tied to a specific concept from the inventory. At least three open questions appear. Open-question count below 3 with concept-inventory ≥4 is reshaped to surface the unknowns.

4. **Domain-structure atom.** Names the organising topology of the domain: `hierarchy` / `hub-and-spoke` / `network` / `chain` / `cluster-bridge`. Where rival schools structure the domain differently, both organising views surface.

5. **Adjacent-domain cross-link atoms.** Each atom names: an adjacent domain and the cross-link concept that connects to it. At least one cross-link with `is_cross_link: true` semantics (Novak's marker of integrative understanding). No-cross-link-trap is the named failure mode; strict tree structures without lateral connections get reshaped to surface ≥1 cross-link.

6. **Boundary-statement atom.** Names what is *out of scope* for the orientation — adjacent domains the map touches but does not survey, sub-areas deferred to follow-on modes, contested-by-the-user framings excluded.

7. **Survey-level discipline atom.** A standing atom: no single sub-area exceeds 30% of the map's content. Premature-depth is the named failure mode; prose that drilled too deeply into one sub-area before mapping the full territory gets reshaped to pull back to survey breadth.

8. **Rival-school representation atoms — when applicable.** Where the domain has rival schools of thought, each school carries its own representation: `the standard view holds X; dissenters argue Y`. The map qualifies authoritative tone when rival schools exist.

9. **Confidence per finding.** Confidence per epistemic-status classification, per concept-mapping, per cross-link.

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut:**

- **Premature depth** — drilling into one sub-area before the full territory is mapped.
- **Textbook trap** — standard overview without known/contested/open classification.
- **False consensus** — one school presented as the domain's view when rival schools exist.
- **No-cross-link** — flat tree without lateral connections to adjacent domains.
- **Low concept count** — fewer than 4 concepts; below threshold, this isn't a survey, it's a clarification.
- **Authoritative tone on contested territory** — assertive framing where qualified framing is honest.
- **Missing boundary** — map without naming what's out of scope; expansion-by-default.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **Epistemic-status tags** — known / contested / open distinctions are operative; tags do not blur.
- **Rival schools** — when the domain has them, both survive with their respective views.
- **Cross-links** — at least one is required; integrative understanding lives in the cross-links.
- **Open questions** — they are the load-bearing finding for orientation; the user needs to know what they don't yet know.
- **Stream disagreement about epistemic status** — when one stream classified a concept as `contested` and another as `known`, the disagreement is itself a finding about the domain's contested-vs-settled boundary.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: focus question stated and matches envelope; ≥4 concepts mapped (below 4 is Deep Clarification territory); each concept classified known/contested/open; ≥1 cross-link to an adjacent domain; ≥3 open questions tied to specific concepts; survey-level discipline maintained (≤30% on any single sub-area); boundary statement names what is out of scope; rival schools represented when domain has them. The four critical questions are addressed in the output.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is a **thorough survey-level orientation map** — a Novak-tradition concept map with epistemic-status tagging per concept, ≥1 cross-link to an adjacent domain, ≥3 open questions tied to specific concepts, and an explicit boundary statement. Place the consolidated-corpus atoms into the following sections, in this order:

1. **Focus question.** One short paragraph stating the orientation question and the user's starting knowledge level.

2. **Known territory.** Bulleted list. Each: `**[Concept]** — epistemic status: known. Brief characterisation: [...]. Position in domain structure: [...].` Concepts here are settled.

3. **Unknown or contested territory.** Bulleted list. Each: `**[Concept]** — epistemic status: [contested / open]. If contested: rival schools represented as 'the standard view holds X; dissenters argue Y'. If open: characterisation of the unknown and why it remains open.`

4. **Open questions.** Numbered list. At least three. Each: `[N]. **[Open question]** — tied to concept: [...]. Why this is operative for orientation: [...].`

5. **Domain structure.** One paragraph. `**Organising topology:** [hierarchy / hub-and-spoke / network / chain / cluster-bridge]. **Prerequisite chains:** [...]. **Where rival schools structure the domain differently:** [...].`

6. **Adjacent connections.** Bulleted list of cross-links. Each: `**[Adjacent domain]** ↔ [concept in this domain]: **cross-link basis:** [shared mechanism / convergent operation / borrowed vocabulary]. **What knowing the adjacent domain unlocks here:** [...].` At least one cross-link surfaces.

7. **Boundary statement.** One paragraph naming what's out of scope. `**This map covers:** [...]. **Out of scope:** [...]. **Adjacent domains touched but not surveyed:** [...]. **Sideways-routes for the out-of-scope material:** [...].`

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 7.
- Epistemic-status tags (`known` / `contested` / `open`) appear verbatim per concept. Untagged concepts are reshaped at this layer.
- Survey-level discipline is enforced — no single sub-area exceeds 30% of the map. Drilling that breached the threshold gets pulled back to survey breadth.
- Rival schools (section 3) carry the qualified-framing pattern `the standard view holds X; dissenters argue Y`. Authoritative single-school framings on contested territory get reshaped.
- Cross-links (section 6) appear in their own section, not buried inside the concept lists. The integrative-understanding signal needs visibility.
- Open questions (section 4) tie to specific concepts. Untied questions get reshaped.
- When envelope-bearing rendering is appropriate: `concept_map` envelope with ≥4 concepts each carrying `hierarchy_level`, ≥2 linking phrases, ≥3 propositions with all ids resolving, ≥1 proposition with `is_cross_link: true`, and `focus_question` matching prose.
- When the concept-count fell below 4 despite the focus question warranting a broader map, the deliverable opens with: `**Note: the domain may be narrower than survey-level orientation requires. Deep-clarification (T10) is the appropriate sideways-route for narrow conceptual deepening; if survey breadth is what's wanted, the focus question may need to widen.**`
