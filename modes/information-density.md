## DEPTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Depth in Information Density is the rigor with which four analytical operations are integrated rather than aggregated: (1) **data-ink ratio audit** (Tufte) — for each mark in the graphic, classify as data-ink (carries data), structure-ink (carries necessary scaffolding: axes, scale references, data-defining frames), or chartjunk (carries decoration / redundancy / moiré / 3D effect / unnecessary color); compute or estimate the ratio; identify specific removals or simplifications without information loss; (2) **visual-variable mapping check** (Bertin) — for each data attribute, identify which visual variable encodes it (position, size, shape, value, color, orientation, texture) and check fitness against the variable's selective / associative / ordered / quantitative properties (e.g., color is selective but not quantitative; position is all four); flag mismatches (categorical data on a quantitative variable like length; quantitative data on a non-ordered variable like color hue); (3) **elementary perceptual task fitness check** (Cleveland-McGill) — identify the perceptual task the graphic requires (position-on-common-scale > nonaligned-position > length > angle > direction > area > volume > color/shading, in descending accuracy); check whether the chart type supports the required task at the accuracy the message demands (e.g., pie charts ask for angle / area judgment; horizontal bar charts ask for length judgment, more accurate); (4) **typographic hierarchy and grid analysis** (Bringhurst / Lupton) where applicable — scale, weight, color, rhythm, measure, leading, grid alignment, the page-as-designed-space; check that hierarchy supports reading order and that the grid carries the composition. A thin pass invokes labels (chartjunk; clean up; improve hierarchy); a substantive pass performs each of the four operations with specific findings and produces specific recommendations. Test depth by asking: could a designer implement the recommendations without further interpretation?

## BREADTH ANALYSIS GUIDANCE

Widening the lens means scanning across the four lens-clusters before narrowing (Tufte data-ink / Bertin visual-variables / Cleveland-McGill perceptual-tasks / Bringhurst-Lupton typography); considering the graphic in its decision-support context (what does the audience need to read off the graphic at a glance, what at sustained attention, what should they decide or notice); considering the chart-type alternatives at the decision point (could a different chart type — small multiples, sparkline, dot plot, slope graph, table — support the elementary task more accurately); considering the constraints (brand / house-style; accessibility — color-blindness, contrast, screen-reader; data-honesty — does the encoding mislead through truncation, area-vs-length confusion, or 3D distortion; audience expectation — convention may justify deviation from theoretical optimum); and noting where the input is part of a larger system (a dashboard's coordination, a report's narrative arc, a presentation's slide rhythm). Breadth markers: at least three of the four lens-clusters substantively addressed (typography skipped only if input is purely chart-without-text); at least one chart-type alternative considered if the chart-type-fit is in question; at least one constraint acknowledged.

## ANALYTICAL BRIEF AND EVALUATION CRITERIA

**What this analysis is.** Information Density is an applied-evaluative info-graphic critique integrating four operations: Tufte data-ink audit (mark-by-mark classification of data-ink / structure-ink / chartjunk), Bertin visual-variable mapping check (selective / associative / ordered / quantitative fitness per data attribute), Cleveland-McGill elementary-perceptual-task assessment (encoding-accuracy ranking), and Bringhurst-Lupton typographic-hierarchy analysis where typography is present. It produces specific, ranked, implementable prescriptive recommendations. It is distinct from compositional-dynamics (universal-perceptual gestalt + Arnheim reading without info-encoding focus), from ma-reading (contemplative aesthetic reading of void / interval), from place-reading-genius-loci (affordance + inhabited-place reading), and from T11 relation-extraction (which reads what a diagram asserts about A→B→C rather than evaluating its encoding). The mode produces prescriptive recommendations grounded in encoding-fitness, not aesthetic preference.

**Procedure.**

1. Lock the information graphic with its intended message (or decision it supports) and its intended audience.
2. Inventory stressors of the graphic — what the audience needs to read at a glance vs sustained attention.
3. Audit data-ink mark by mark — classify each as `data-ink` (carries data), `structure-ink` (axes / scale references / data-defining frames), or `chartjunk` (decoration / redundancy / moiré / 3D / unnecessary color). Estimate the ratio; name specific removable elements.
4. Check Bertin visual-variable mapping per data attribute — identify the variable encoding it (position / size / shape / value / colour / orientation / texture), check fitness against the variable's properties (`selective` / `associative` / `ordered` / `quantitative`), flag mismatches with distortion mechanism.
5. Identify the elementary perceptual task the message demands (Cleveland-McGill: `position-on-common-scale` > `nonaligned-position` > `length` > `angle` > `direction` > `area` > `volume` > `color/shading`, descending accuracy) and check chart-type support at the demanded accuracy.
6. Analyze typographic hierarchy and grid where input includes typography — scale, weight, colour, rhythm, measure, leading, grid alignment.
7. Produce prescriptive recommendations — each specific (which mark to change, which encoding to substitute, which element to remove, which hierarchy to strengthen), ranked by impact, with the diagnosing operation named.
8. Acknowledge residual tradeoffs and constraints — brand, accessibility, data-honesty, audience-expectation, system-coordination — recommendations that conflict get flagged with resolution paths.
9. Hold Tufte minimalism as default but not dogma — contexts where minor redundancy / framing / annotation actively serves the audience are real.
10. Calibrate confidence per recommendation (`high-confidence` / `medium-confidence` / `low-confidence`) with grounding.

**Goal.** Produce a prescriptive critique of an information graphic — a structured audit that runs the four operations (Tufte / Bertin / Cleveland-McGill / Bringhurst-Lupton) on a named graphic and produces specific, ranked, implementable recommendations.

**Evaluation criteria (what evaluators grade against and analysts write to satisfy).**

- **CQ1 — Cleveland-McGill task fitness.** Has the analysis identified the elementary perceptual task the graphic requires and assessed whether the visual encoding supports that task at the accuracy the message demands? Failure mode if unmet: `elementary-task-mismatch-undiagnosed`.
- **CQ2 — Bertin mapping check.** Has the visual-variable-to-data-attribute mapping been checked for fitness against Bertin properties (selective / associative / ordered / quantitative)? Failure mode if unmet: `bertin-mapping-unchecked`.
- **CQ3 — data-ink audited specifically.** Has data-ink ratio been audited mark by mark, or has "too much chartjunk" been asserted as a vague label? Failure mode if unmet: `data-ink-as-slogan`.
- **CQ4 — typographic hierarchy analyzed.** Has Bringhurst-Lupton typographic hierarchy and grid analysis been performed where the input includes typography? Failure mode if unmet: `typography-as-not-encoding`.
- **CQ5 — recommendations specific.** Are prescriptive recommendations specific (which mark / encoding / element / hierarchy), or general gestures (simplify, declutter, improve hierarchy)? Failure mode if unmet: `recommendations-as-gestures`.
- **CQ6 — constraints acknowledged.** Have residual tradeoffs and constraints (brand, accessibility, data-honesty, audience-expectation) been acknowledged? Failure mode if unmet: `constraint-blindness`.

A passing output addresses all four operations substantively, produces specific prescriptive recommendations a designer could implement without further interpretation, ranks them by impact, acknowledges residual constraints, holds Tufte minimalism as default-but-not-dogma, grounds critique in encoding-fitness rather than aesthetic preference, and assigns confidence per recommendation.

**Named failure modes.**

- *elementary-task-mismatch-undiagnosed* — Cleveland-McGill ranking not applied; encoding-fitness for the elementary perceptual task not assessed.
- *bertin-mapping-unchecked* — visual-variable-to-data-attribute mapping not assessed against Bertin properties.
- *data-ink-as-slogan* — data-ink ratio invoked as a label without auditing specific marks.
- *typography-as-not-encoding* — typography in the input but hierarchy and grid analysis skipped; text treated as carrier rather than encoding.
- *recommendations-as-gestures* — recommendations general (simplify, declutter, improve hierarchy) rather than mark / encoding / element / hierarchy specific.
- *constraint-blindness* — recommendations asserted without acknowledging brand / accessibility / data-honesty / audience-expectation constraints.
- *tufte-orthodoxy* — Tufte minimalism applied dogmatically without acknowledging contexts where minor redundancy / annotation actively serves the audience.
- *aesthetic-only-critique* — critique addresses aesthetic preferences without grounding in encoding-fitness or perceptual-task analysis.
- *m5-promotion-evidence* — repeated invocations encountering dashboard-orchestration / chart-type-selection / sparkline-specialty cases this mode handles awkwardly (signals Reserved-M5 promotion threshold).

## REVISION GUIDANCE

Revise to identify the elementary perceptual task and check encoding-fitness where the draft skipped Cleveland-McGill. Revise to check visual-variable mapping where the draft skipped Bertin. Revise to audit specific marks where the draft asserted "chartjunk" generically. Revise to perform typographic hierarchy analysis where the draft skipped typography-as-encoding. Revise to make recommendations specific (which mark, which encoding, which element, which hierarchy) where the draft offered gestures. Revise to acknowledge constraints (brand / accessibility / data-honesty / audience-expectation) where the draft asserted recommendations as unconstrained. Resist revising toward Tufte orthodoxy — the mode's character is *applied-evaluative-medium-depth* with prescriptive recommendation; minimalism is a strong default but not a dogma, and contexts where minor redundancy / framing / annotation actively serves the audience or message are real. Resist revising toward aesthetic-only critique — the mode is grounded in encoding-fitness and perceptual-task analysis, not in aesthetic preference.

## CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE

Organize the consolidated corpus as **an applied-evaluative encoding-fitness audit: graphic-and-message lock, mark-by-mark data-ink atoms, Bertin visual-variable-mapping atoms per data attribute, Cleveland-McGill elementary-perceptual-task atom, Bringhurst-Lupton typographic-hierarchy atoms, chartjunk inventory, specific prescriptive-recommendation atoms with ranked impact, residual-constraint atoms, and per-recommendation confidence**. The atoms are:

1. **Graphic-and-message atom.** The information graphic being audited, plus the intended message it should communicate (or the decision it should support) and the intended audience. One short paragraph; the audit holds this lock throughout.

2. **Data-ink atoms — per mark.** Each mark in the graphic is classified as `data-ink` (carries data), `structure-ink` (carries necessary scaffolding: axes, scale references, data-defining frames), or `chartjunk` (decoration, redundancy, moiré, 3D effect, unnecessary colour). The ratio is computed or estimated. Data-ink-as-slogan is the named failure mode the consolidator watches for; atoms that invoke "chartjunk" as a label without classifying specific marks get reshaped to per-mark classification.

3. **Visual-variable mapping atoms — per data attribute.** Each data attribute carries: the variable encoding it (position, size, shape, value, colour, orientation, texture), and a fitness assessment against Bertin's properties (`selective` / `associative` / `ordered` / `quantitative`). Mismatches (categorical data on a quantitative variable like length; quantitative data on a non-ordered variable like colour hue) are flagged with their distortion mechanism. Bertin-mapping-unchecked is the named failure mode.

4. **Elementary-perceptual-task atom.** The task the graphic requires (Cleveland-McGill ranking: `position-on-common-scale` > `nonaligned-position` > `length` > `angle` > `direction` > `area` > `volume` > `color/shading`, in descending accuracy), plus an assessment of whether the chart-type supports the task at the accuracy the message demands. Elementary-task-mismatch-undiagnosed is the named failure mode.

5. **Typographic-hierarchy and grid atoms.** Where the input includes typography (chart labels, dashboard text, page layout), each atom carries: scale, weight, colour, rhythm, measure, leading, grid alignment, and whether the hierarchy supports the reading order the message requires. Typography-as-not-encoding is the named failure mode; inputs with typography that skipped hierarchy analysis get reshaped. (If input is purely chart-without-text, this atom is replaced with a `not-applicable — chart-without-text` marker.)

6. **Chartjunk and redundancy inventory atoms.** Each removable element is named with: what it is, what it contributes (decoration / redundancy / unnecessary structure), and what would be lost or gained by removing it.

7. **Prescriptive-recommendation atoms.** Each recommendation carries: a *specific* change (which mark to alter, which encoding to substitute, which element to remove, which hierarchy to strengthen), the operation that diagnosed the problem (Tufte / Bertin / Cleveland-McGill / Bringhurst-Lupton), and an impact rank (high / medium / low). Recommendations-as-gestures is the named failure mode; "simplify / declutter / improve hierarchy" without specific changes gets reshaped.

8. **Residual-tradeoff and constraint atoms.** Each atom names a place where the prescriptive recommendation conflicts with: brand or house-style, accessibility requirements, data-honesty considerations, audience expectations (convention as warrant), or system-level coordination (a dashboard's other views). Constraint-blindness is the named failure mode.

9. **Tufte-orthodoxy flag — when applicable.** Where streams applied data-ink maximisation dogmatically without acknowledging contexts where minor redundancy / framing / annotation actively serves the audience or message, the flag is preserved. Tufte-orthodoxy is the named failure mode.

10. **Aesthetic-only-critique flag — when applicable.** Where critique addressed aesthetic preferences ("looks ugly", "is busy") without grounding in encoding-fitness or perceptual-task analysis, the flag is preserved. Aesthetic-only-critique is the named failure mode.

11. **Reserved-M5 promotion signal — when applicable.** Where the audit encountered dashboard-orchestration / chart-type-selection / sparkline-specialty operations this mode handles awkwardly, the `m5-promotion-evidence` flag is preserved for orchestrator review per T19 reserved-M5 spec.

12. **Confidence per recommendation** — distinguishing `high-confidence` (encoding-misfit clearly diagnosed; replacement clearly better) from `medium-confidence` (tradeoff-dependent) from `low-confidence` (depends on audience testing).

**Mode-specific bloat patterns to cut:**

- **Chartjunk as label** — "data-ink ratio is low" or "too much chartjunk" without per-mark classification.
- **Bertin mapping skipped** — encoding assumed appropriate without selective/associative/ordered/quantitative fitness check.
- **Cleveland-McGill ranking absent** — encoding-accuracy not assessed against the elementary perceptual task the message demands.
- **Typography-as-carrier** — chart labels and dashboard text treated as content rather than as encoding.
- **Gesture recommendations** — "simplify", "declutter", "improve hierarchy" without specifying which mark / encoding / element / hierarchy.
- **Unconstrained recommendations** — brand / accessibility / data-honesty / audience-expectation conflicts not acknowledged.
- **Tufte orthodoxy** — minimalism applied dogmatically without acknowledging audience-serving redundancy or annotation.
- **Aesthetic-only critique** — "ugly" or "busy" without encoding-fitness grounding.
- **Verbal-sketch overreach** — auditing claims that the visual evidence does not support; for hand-sketched or low-fidelity input, the corpus flags degraded-audit explicitly rather than producing mark-by-mark claims that aren't grounded.

**What NOT to collapse:**

- **Stream disagreement about elementary perceptual task** — when streams identified different operative tasks for the same graphic (e.g., one stream: position-on-common-scale comparison; another: length judgment), both readings survive; the disagreement reveals what's contested about the intended message.
- **Tufte-minimalism vs. audience-serving redundancy** — when one stream recommended removal and another argued the redundancy serves the audience, both readings survive with their grounding.
- **Encoding-fitness vs. convention** — when the theoretically optimal encoding deviates from audience convention, both considerations survive; the audience's expectation is itself a constraint, not a bug.
- **Reserved-M5 boundary cases** — when streams diverged on whether the input falls inside this mode's scope or is a dashboard-orchestration / chart-type-selection / sparkline-specialty case better served by a future Reserved-M5 mode, the disagreement survives as promotion-signal evidence.

## VERIFICATION CRITERIA

Verified means: graphic and intended message identified; data-ink ratio audited with specific marks classified; visual-variable mapping checked per Bertin properties for each data attribute; elementary perceptual task identified and encoding-fitness assessed per Cleveland-McGill ranking; typographic hierarchy and grid analyzed where applicable; chartjunk and redundancy inventory present; at least three prescriptive recommendations specific (which mark / encoding / element / hierarchy) and ranked by impact; residual tradeoffs and constraints acknowledged; the six critical questions are addressable from the output. Confidence per recommendation accompanies each claim. Cross-reference to T19 territory-level open debates is noted where the analysis depends on contested framing decisions (especially Debate 5 on AI implementability of perceptual operations for direct-image vs. verbal-description input — Information Density degrades for hand-sketched info-graphics where mark-by-mark audit is impossible). The Reserved-M5 promotion threshold is monitored: if this mode begins failing on dashboard-orchestration / chart-type-selection / sparkline-specialty cases, surface that signal for orchestrator review per T19 reserved-M5 spec.

## OUTPUT FORMAT GUIDANCE

The deliverable is a **prescriptive critique of an information graphic** — a structured audit that runs the four operations (Tufte data-ink, Bertin visual-variables, Cleveland-McGill perceptual-tasks, Bringhurst-Lupton typographic hierarchy) on a named graphic and produces specific, ranked, implementable recommendations. Place the consolidated-corpus atoms into the following sections, in this order:

1. **Graphic summary and intended message.** One short paragraph identifying the graphic, the message or decision it should support, and the intended audience.

2. **Data-ink ratio audit.** A table or three-column block. Each mark or mark-class: `**[Mark]** — classification: [data-ink / structure-ink / chartjunk]. Function: [...].` A summary line: `Estimated data-ink ratio: [proportion]. Specific marks removable without information loss: [list].`

3. **Visual-variable to data-attribute mapping check.** A table. Each row: `**[Data attribute]** — encoded by: [position / size / shape / value / colour / orientation / texture]. Bertin fitness: [selective / associative / ordered / quantitative — match or mismatch with attribute type]. Verdict: [appropriate / suboptimal / mismatched]. Mechanism if mismatched: [...].`

4. **Elementary perceptual task fitness check.** One paragraph naming the elementary task the message demands (Cleveland-McGill vocabulary verbatim: position-on-common-scale / nonaligned-position / length / angle / direction / area / volume / color/shading), the chart-type-supported task, and the gap if any. Where the chart-type does not support the required task at the accuracy the message demands, a labelled `**Encoding-task mismatch:** [specifics].` line surfaces it.

5. **Typographic hierarchy and grid analysis.** Where the input includes typography: a labelled block walking scale, weight, colour, rhythm, measure, leading, grid alignment. Where the input is chart-without-text: `Not applicable — input has no typographic encoding.`

6. **Chartjunk and redundancy inventory.** Bulleted list. Each: `**[Element]** — what it is / what it contributes / what would change if removed.`

7. **Prescriptive recommendations — ranked.** A numbered list ordered by impact (high-impact first). Each: `[N]. **[Specific change — which mark / encoding / element / hierarchy]** — diagnosis: [Tufte / Bertin / Cleveland-McGill / Bringhurst-Lupton]. Impact: [high / medium / low]. Expected effect: [...].` Recommendations are specific enough that a designer could implement them without further interpretation.

8. **Residual tradeoffs and constraints.** Bulleted list. Each: `**[Constraint — brand / accessibility / data-honesty / audience-expectation / system-coordination]** — recommendation it conflicts with: [...]. Resolution path: [implement anyway / hold / partial / route to design-review].`

9. **Confidence per recommendation.** Bulleted list of confidence assessments (`high-confidence / medium-confidence / low-confidence`) with grounding per recommendation.

10. **Annotated visual overlay (when image attached).** When the user attached a photograph or raster image, optionally emit one `annotated_image` envelope to overlay annotations on the user's uploaded image at normalized image-relative coordinates. `canvas_action: annotate`; one envelope per response. Each annotation entry carries `kind` (callout / box / arrow / highlight / text), normalized `x: 0–1`, `y: 0–1` (top-left origin), and optional `width: 0–1`, `height: 0–1`, `to_x: 0–1`, `to_y: 0–1`. Use this overlay to mark data-ink violation regions, perceptual-task ranking failures, typography-as-encoding instances, and identified chartjunk marks. Schema and full envelope skeleton in `modes/spatial-reasoning.md §7 Path B`.

**Per-section conventions:**

- Use H2 headings for sections 1 through 9.
- Vocabulary stays operative: `data-ink`, `structure-ink`, `chartjunk`, the seven Bertin variables, the eight Cleveland-McGill elementary tasks, and the Bringhurst-Lupton typographic primitives appear verbatim where they apply.
- Recommendations (section 7) are mark-specific, encoding-specific, or hierarchy-specific — never generic gestures. Gestural recommendations are reshaped at this layer.
- When the Tufte-orthodoxy flag survived consolidation, section 7 opens with: `**Note: minimalism is the default but not a dogma. Where minor redundancy / framing / annotation actively serves the audience or message, recommendations below honour that.**`
- When the input is hand-sketched or low-fidelity (visual evidence insufficient for mark-by-mark audit), the deliverable surfaces a degraded-audit flag at the top: `**Note: input fidelity is insufficient for full mark-by-mark audit (per T19 Debate 4 on verbal-accessibility for AI implementation). Findings below are partial; specific marks named are inferred rather than directly observed.**`
- When the reserved-M5 promotion signal fired (dashboard-orchestration / chart-type-selection / sparkline-specialty operations awkwardly handled), section 8 carries a closing line: `**Promotion-signal note:** this audit encountered operations the Reserved-M5 mode (Information-Graphic Visual-Hierarchy specialty) would handle more directly. Surface for T19 reserved-M5 promotion-threshold review.`
- Confidence (section 9) stays per-recommendation; collapsing into an overall audit-confidence is reshaped at this layer.

## CAVEATS AND OPEN DEBATES

This mode does not carry mode-specific debates. Five territory-level debates (per Decision G) are documented in `Reference — Analytical Territories.md` T19 entry and bear on Information Density specifically:

1. **Spatial vs. compositional framing.** Information Density operates on spatial info-graphics; the temporal generalization (animated charts, slide sequences over time) is partially relevant — the mode handles slide-rhythm and presentation-arc as breadth scanning, but its core operations are on static graphics.
2. **Aesthetic-only or also abstract spatial inputs?** Information Density sits firmly on the *applied-analytical* side of this debate: the traditions (Tufte, Bertin, Cleveland-McGill, Bringhurst, Lupton) operate on functional info-graphics with prescriptive critique, not on aesthetic-experiential reading. The territory's coherence rests on the operation (read spatial structure as primary content with consequence) being shared with aesthetic-experiential modes (ma-reading) and applied-evaluative modes like this one.
3. **Western-analytical and Eastern-aesthetic: same operation or convergent traditions?** Information Density is firmly Western-analytical; the Eastern-aesthetic question bears on the territory's overall framing more than on this mode's internal stance. The Bringhurst case for "page-as-composition" is a Western analog of ma-reading's white-space attention, but applied prescriptively rather than contemplatively.
4. **Verbal accessibility for AI implementation.** Information Density requires direct image input or high-fidelity verbal-spatial description (mark inventory, encoding identification, scale and proportion data, typography specifications) for the data-ink audit and visual-variable mapping check to be performed mark-by-mark. The mode degrades for rough verbal sketch where critical features (which marks carry data vs. decoration; which visual variable encodes which attribute; which elementary task the chart requires) cannot be inferred. This is a real implementation constraint, not academic.
5. **Mode granularity: general vs. tradition-specific.** Whether the Reserved-M5 mode (Information-Graphic Visual-Hierarchy Analysis specialty) should be promoted to a first-class fifth T19 mode. Per T19 reanalysis §3, the promotion threshold is: info-graphic critique exceeds ~15% of T19 invocations, *or* this mode plus Compositional Dynamics outputs on dashboards visibly fail to distinguish encoding-misfit from generic compositional critique. Below threshold, Information Density covers the applied-evaluative info-graphic operations with the four required lenses. Above threshold, dashboard-orchestration / chart-type-selection / sparkline-and-small-multiples specialty would justify a fifth mode. The `m5-promotion-evidence` failure-mode flag is the structural mechanism for surfacing the signal to the orchestrator.

These five debates are *not* re-documented here. They are referenced because they bear on Information Density's stance, lens dependencies, and implementability. See the T19 entry in `Reference — Analytical Territories.md` for the full debate text and citations.
